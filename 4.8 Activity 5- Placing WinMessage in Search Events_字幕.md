Activity 5, Placing WinMessage in Search Events. In this activity, we'll review the activity overview and place the WinMessage in SearchInit and SearchSave events so that you can see exactly when these events run in the component processor flow.

Activity Overview-- by placing a WinMessage function call in an event, you can see exactly when that event runs. In this activity, we'll place WinMessage in SearchSave and SearchInit events.

Activity Detailed Steps-- perform the detailed steps to complete the activity. Placing WinMessage in SearchSave and SearchInit events-- to place WinMessage in SearchSave and SearchInit events in PeopleSoft Application Designer, open the PSU_INSTR component definition. Select the Structure tab. Right-click on the PSU_INSTR component, and select the View PeopleCode. From the left dropdown list, select PSU_INSTR_TBL record. And from the right-hand side, we'll select SearchInit.

We go back over here to our Application Designer. I'll close what I have currently open. We'll say File, Open Component, and we'll say PSU_INSTR. We'll go to the Structure tab. We'll right-click on the PSU_INSTR component, say View PeopleCode. And we'll hit the dropdown here, and we'll choose to use the PSU_INSTR_TBL record. And for our event, we'll use SearchInit.

Enter the following code. Important, throughout this guide, the location for your PeopleCode program is designated in square brackets. The square brackets in the information included within them must not be entered as part of the program.

So here, we can see our code that we're going to be putting in here. We're going to set up a component integer_&C. We'll say &C = &C + 1. We'll do a WinMessage SearchInit component PSU_INSTR, PSU_INSTR_TBL. That's all literal text. Concatenate that with the record field PSU_INSTR_TBL.INSTRUCTOR. Concatenate that with the literal text of "Counter =", and concatenate that with the &C of the actual value.

And let me go in here and put this in. I'll say, we'll declare it, component, and we'll say integer_&C. I'll say &C = &C + 1. And then I'll do a WinMessage. And we'll say, in literal text and double quotes, we'll say SearchInit on Component.PSU_INSTR, comma, PSU_INSTR_TBL, space, and our literal text.

And then I'll do a space, and I'll do a single pipe, which is to concatenate. And then I'll say PSU_INSTR field, or I could just say Instructor. Concatenate that with literal text, and we'll say "Counter =", space, and the literal text. Concatenate with &C. Close my parentheses and put my semicolon here.

And I'll validate to see how many typos I have. Oh, look at it there. No typos? That's unusual for me. And I'm going to be a little lazy, and I'm just going to copy this information that I have here, copy it to my clipboard. And if I come back over to my training environment, it says, step number 7, from the right dropdown, select SearchSave.

And we're going to set up some similar code inside here with our SearchSave. The only difference is our text that we're going to put in here is going to say SearchSave instead of SearchInit. If I come back over here to our Application Designer and hit my dropdown over here on the right and say, go into the event called SearchSave, I'll paste this information in, and I'll change this from SearchInit to SearchSave. Validate. Looking good in the neighborhood. And I'll hit Save.

And step 9, let's hit Save. In the browser, select Instructors, Professional Details. Click OK to dismiss the SearchInit message. Search page for Instructor, Professional Details appears. So if I come over here and click on my Home and go to my nav bar, go to my Navigator, Instructors, Professional Details, and here you can see the SearchInit event immediately get executed. SearchInit on component, PSU_INSTR_TBL, counter is equal to 1.

So I'll hit OK on this. And now it takes me onto my search page. For instructor, enter JEG, and then click the Search button. And click OK to dismiss the SearchSave message. I'll put in my JEG, and I do a search. Now you see, my SearchSave message pops up. SearchSave on component, PSU_INSTR_TBL, JEG, counter is now equal to 2. So we've incremented the counter that's on our search area.

I'll hit my OK, and now it takes me into my page. The Instructor Professionals Detail page appears. It says, results before the search page is displayed, SearchInit fires, and the following code is displayed. Then, once the search results is selected, SearchSave fires, and the following results are displayed. This concludes the activity. Please do not continue.
