Lesson 5, writing PeopleCode programs. Our objectives. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to write PeopleCode statements, write conditional statements, and write looping statements.

So writing PeopleCode statements. Statements in PeopleCode program is made up of statements. A statement can be a declaration of a variable, function, class, method or property. An assignment of a value, a language construct, such as a branching structure or a looping structure. Functional implication or a method implication. Could be a comment.

And it tells you every PeopleCode statement should end with a semicolon. Now, there are some exceptions to that, but you could think of the semicolon as being the terminator of a statement. So in the case of an if then statement, the if, if the PSU task resource completed flag Y then, I don't need a semicolon at the end of that one, because a statement actually doesn't get terminated until you get to the end if.

But each statement inside the if statement would have a semicolon. With a if statement, a branching statement, it's if then else end if block as a single statement. Then it becomes clear why a semicolon appears after the end if, not after the then. Same is true for other branching statements such as a for loop.

Assignment statements. You assign a value in PeopleCode by setting a field, variable, object property, or object equal to another field, variable, object property, object expression, or the result of a function or method invocation. So if I look over here, you see an example of a rec name field name or maybe a variable or maybe an object dot property or maybe just an object is equal and then you see again on the opposite side a record name, field name, a variable, an object property, or the object.

Expression, functions, and methods. So when we're looking at examples down here of talking about working with PeopleCode statements, here it's showing you some examples of declaring objects or declaring variables out here. So here you see an example of local string ampersand S1 ampersand S2. So we can declare two variables on the same line. So they're available to be used on the local event only in they're of type string.

Here you see an example of ampersand S1 equals, and I can assign a value a literal string two is string one. You put the literal value in double quotes. We could say ampersand S2 is equal to ampersand S1. So a variable is equal to a variable. Ampersand S2 equals, and you could say now put in a new string inside here. We can also work with object oriented objects.

So the previous example was shown as previous data types, like string, numbers, and dates. We can also work with object data types. So here's an example. Local row set ampersand rows set one ampersand row set two. So I'm declaring two row set objects. The next one is instantiating the row set. Ampersand row set one equals create row set record dot PSU task. Or here saying row set two is equal to row set one. Or row set two equals get row set record dot PSU task resource. So another way of instantiating, but this time a row set. We'll get into the object oriented in more detail on it later on in the course.

Writing PeopleCode statements. Here talking about comments. Three different ways you can insert comments into PeopleCode. One of them is you can use a rem or remark. Comments until the first semicolon. So typically, this would be used if I just want to comment a single line from executing. I might just do a rem in front of it. I call that the old basic method in programming.

Then you have the C style comment where you can do a forward slash asterisk. And then when you're done with the comment, you end it with an asterisk forward slash. And you can comment up to multiple lines when using this method.

Or you can use block comments. Block comments, you use your tags or your greater than, less than symbols. So you see the left hand tag or the less than symbol asterisk and then whatever you want to have comment, and then you end it with an asterisk greater than symbol.

Now, this is a good way of blocking lines of code that might already have comments in it. You choose the way you like best. There is a fourth method of comments that we have out here, which is the [? forward ?] sign plus sign. And then it ends with a plus sign forward slash. But you don't actually write these type of comments. These comments are put in by the compiler automatically.

And here's an example of where you see some examples of comments being used inside here. Here you see an example of the forward slash plus and the plus forward slash. So these are going to be put in automatically by the compiler for methods and property signatures inside an application class definition. Again, you don't create these type of comments.

Mathematical operators you can use in PeopleCode. So you see the plus sign for addition. So ampersand price plus ampersand tax. For subtraction, you use the hyphen or the minus sign. Ampersand gross minus ampersand tax. You see you can be using a unary negation. So minus ampersand deductions.

You have the multiplication is the asterisk. So ampersand price asterisk ampersand quantity. For division, you use the forward slash ampersand annual payments divided by 12. And then exponential or exponentiation is two asterisks. So radius two asterisks and a two. So let's take it exponentially by the power of two.

When it comes to mathematical operations, it follows your standard order of operations. So PeopleCode follows the standard order of operations, which can be summarized with the mnemonic PEMDAS, Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally, or something like that, which means Parentheses, Explanation, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction operations are done at the same rank are evaluated from left to right. And again, you can override the order of operations by using your parentheses.

Date and time operators. This table describes different mathematical operations that can be performed using date and time fields. So here you see we got operation time plus or minus a number of seconds. Resulting data type would be a time field. And it would be the resulting time. You could do a time minus time. Resulting data type would be a number, which would be the difference in seconds.

We can do a date plus or minus a number of days. Results in a date, the resulting date. You can do a date minus date, results in a number difference in the two dates. And then you can do a date plus time, which would resolve into a date time data type. And that would be the date and time would be combined.

So for example, if I came over here and I was writing in my PeopleCode, if I said ampersand and I said date 1 is equal to I can say ampersand date plus 7. And if I did this, this would say-- when I'm setting up this, it would say take today's date seven days from today's day. And percent day-- whoops. I just looked at it and I put in the wrong thing here. So this should be percent date. So percent date would be a system variable that we could set up inside here.

If we're working on time, you could add a number, and it will be in seconds. So similarly, I could come in here and I could say ampersand time is equal to percent time plus 300. And if I did that, that would say add 5 minutes to the current time. When it comes to percent day and percent time, these options are getting today's day or today's time, they're going to the database server to get this information.

Writing conditional statements if then else constructs. So PeopleCode uses a standard if then else construct for branching. The syntax is if condition, then statement list. You optionally could have an else statement list, and then for every if, you must have a end if. So I could have nested ifs.

I could come in here and possibly put in something such as maybe I could say if percent mode, meaning the mode of the action for the component, if it is equal to a in double quotes, and then I could say inside here, I could say if ampersand find is greater than 0, then and I could do something. I might say error. What are you thinking? And then I would have a end if and a end if. So I can go out here and nest my if statements.

I could have a else inside here. If I wanted an else, I could say if ampersand variable 1 is equal to 5, then and I could say set my ampersand variable text equal to Greg is great. Else I could say set my variable text to be equal to Greg is so good looking. Yeah, these are very important things to put into your PeopleCode. And then I would end it with a end if.

Now, one thing you can't do in PeopleCode, you can't have an else if. It's not valid inside PeopleSoft. Else if is how you would write case logic, which in PeopleSoft is actually going to be done with an evaluate statement.

So we're looking over here, our branching logic. If an if construct can be complex, there might be multiple conditions in the if clause, multiple statements in the then and else calls, and nested if constructs. Nested if constructs are an implied Boolean and statement.

Relational and Boolean operators. The standard relational operators available in PeopleCode. We have the equal, not equal. You see the exclamation point equals or the two tags greater than, less than symbols. Greater than, less than, greater than or equal, less than or equal. Multiple conditions can be set up using the Boolean logic. Standard Boolean operators are available in PeopleCode programs. So we have not and an or.

So I could come out here and possibly maybe I want to say-- I could say if A and B or C. I could do something similar to this. If I did this, this would do A and B or C. It's the way it would execute. Don't need parentheses, but parentheses makes it easier to read. So when it comes to the statements of evaluation of using not and an or, multiple conditions can be set up using these.

PeopleCode applies not operators first, then and operators, and then or operators. You can use parentheses to explicitly define the order of operations precedence. The not operator can be applied to the relational operators. For example, not equal not less than not greater than. Errors and warnings should only occur when the value of a field becomes invalid. Therefore, conditions are evaluated prior to issuing errors or warnings. For example an unconditional error in field edit, for instance, would prevent a field from ever changing.

Using a function called error function. The error function displays a message to the user and stops the process until the user corrects the data. So the syntax you see is error and then a string. So an example here shows you if all in the employee's birthdate all returns true as long as there is a value in the birthday, as long as it's not null.

Then if employee.birthday is greater than percent date, meaning if it's greater than today's date, then error. Birthdate is after today's date. And if. Notice I don't have that parentheses after the error is optional. Typically I put parentheses in it, but here's an example of showing you where we don't have any parentheses in here.

When we talk about an error, what are the things that an error function does? Well, the first thing to mention is it displays an error message. That kind of makes sense, doesn't it? But in addition to that, it also stops the processing. That is, no further PeopleCode statements in that program would be executed. In a field edit, if it was placed in field edit, it turns the field red and does not navigate out of the field.

Similar to the error, we have a warning function. The warning function displays a message to the user informing them that the data may be invalid. It allows the user to decide whether or not to continue processing. Syntax would be warning and then a string of text of what you want it to say.

So here it says if all job original hired date employee hire date, again, the all is a function that returns true as long as there is a value in it, when we talk about what constitutes a value or not a value, not a value for a date field would be null. If it's a numeric field would be 0. For a character field, it would be blank.

But we're saying if all if there's something in the hire date in the job original hire date and there's something in the employments table, a hire date, and the job's original hire date is greater than the employment's hire date, then warning. Original hire date should not be after hire date. End if.

So with a warning message, how's that going to differ from a error message? Well, with a warning, it displays a message, just like an error message does. But in this case, it doesn't stop processing. The user decides whether or not they want to continue processing. So in the case of a warning, they have the option to say nope, I want to cancel out of here and fix this. Or they can go ahead and hit Save and continue on. And again, all and none can be used to evaluate multiple fields inside a structure.

Optional parentheses. The use of parentheses is optional with errors and warning functions. If the only argument is a simple texturing, we can just put in the string. But here you see in this warning down below, we're doing a message get. In that case, message get would have parentheses. But the warning itself could have had parentheses, but they chose not to.

Parentheses are recommended, and I mentioned that earlier. And here's an example of error parentheses are recommended. And then in literal text, it says that. Then we're doing a concatenate with a variable employee birthdate and concatenate that with additional literal text. And again, literal text always put in between double quotes.
