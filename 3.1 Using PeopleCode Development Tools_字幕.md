Lesson 3, Using PeopleCode Development Tools. Our objectives, by the end of this lesson, you'll be able to describe the PeopleSoft application development steps, locate PeopleCode programs, use the PeopleCode editor, use the PeopleCode debugger, and describe additional development tools.

Development environment, the difference between a PeopleSoft development environment and a user environment is in a development environment, developers and administrators typically connect to the PeopleSoft databases through a two-tier or three-tier connection. Two-tier would mean that the developer's workstation has database connectivity. We have to have ODBCs or tnsnames.ora files, database drivers. But when we're doing development work, we're saving it directly to the database.

With a three-tier connection, it means our development workstation does not need database connectivity. When we're saving our development work, we're sending a tuxedo message to the application server domain. And the application server domain is connecting to the database to save the data into the database.

In a development environment, we're typically using tools such as Application Designer or Data Mover. In a user environment, end users typically connect to PeopleSoft applications using a web browser. We call this an in-tier connection. No code on the client. So we refer to this connection often as the PIA, PeopleSoft Internet Architecture.

And with this connection, we connect from a browser via HTTP to a web server. The web server will then take our-- whatever we're requesting and translate it into a Jolt message, which will be used to communicate to the application server domain. The application server domain will then communicate via to the database, via TCPIP using SQL. And then, of course, it will send the information back through the web server back to the browser.

PeopleSoft Application Designer interface. The PeopleSoft Application Designer interface is divided into three areas. We have our project workspace, our definition workspace, and our output window. Let's take a few moments and just take a look at that real quick. Come over to our training environment.

If I take the photo on our desktop called PeopleTools. And here we'll see some shortcuts that have been made for our training class. One of them you'll see is Application Designer. I'm going to right-click on it and say send that to my desktop, because we'll be using this all week long. And if I come over here, you see we got Configuration Manager. And I'm going to double-click on Configuration Manager issues to set up and configure the developer's workstation.

Here you see, by default, we'll be connecting in as two-tier connection, using the Oracle database, Database instance T1B85701. And we see our user ID, PTTRN. Well, in this class, we're going to be using the user ID PTCODE. So I'm going to change that to PTCODE. That's the only thing I need to change here. That way it'll default in each day when I go to sign into Application Designer.

You see the connect ID and connect password. That's a database ID and password that's used to connect me initially to the database to validate my entry of PTCODE, the PeopleSoft user ID. And then in the background is going to connect me to the database is a different ID that as a user you would not know.

I'm going to go and hit OK, and I'll close this window down. And here I'm going to double-click on my Application Designer. And I'm signed in to My Oracle T1B85701 database using the user ID and password of PTCODE. When I first sign in into Application Designer, here you see the three windows that we was looking at-- or actually, we're looking at four windows here that the book was discussing.

Over here on the left-hand side, you see the project workspace. So we do our development inside of a project, and a project is a way of organizing development, typically to be able to migrate it from the development environment through the task through to production. If I come over here and do a File, Open, and I say Project, I'm going to open up a project called PSU Task. This is a project that we're going to work with this week, almost exclusively, or it might be exclusively. Can't remember.

But when I open up our project, you see a project is made up of folders, and these folders are made up of definition types. So folders are a way of organizing the definitions. So here you see we've got some components and pages and records. And I can open up, for example, a page. And if I double-click it, I'll open it up in the middle area. That is called my definition workspace.

So anything you're creating or modifying has to be opened in the definition workspace. If I look down below, you'll see we have an output window. So the output window allows me the ability to take a look at results of whatever I've just done. If I go out here and, for example, I might want to go out there and look at my PeopleCode, do a validate. And then it would take me to this Validate tab and let me know if my PeopleCode was valid.

Or maybe I'm generating a table, and the build table-- the build tab would open up to let me know if my build was successful. If I was migrating data, I'd be working with the Upgrade tab. The output window shows up at the bottom, where you should get accustomed to checking the messages that are being written to it.

And if we look over here on the right, you see we've got a newer feature out here that came in 857, which is called my property window. So when I set my focus on a, let's say, a page field for example, it brings up the properties for that page field. And I could go in here and take a look at all these different properties. Not everything shows up, but probably about 80% of it. And not only does it show up, inside here you have the ability to make changes from here. So I could say, make that display only if I wanted to. Don't want to, but I could.

If I want to close this temporarily for this one session, I can hit my Alt 2, and that will shut that one down. You might remember, Alt 0 closes your project workspace window. Alt 0 bring it back. Alt 2 would bring back the property window again if I wanted it open. Alt 1 would close the output window or open it back up, toggling it between them.

Back over here to our guide. And as what they're shown us here is the Application Designer interface guide, and we can see we can open up definitions to insert into a project by doing a file open and look for whatever we're going to be modifying. And we can open it up into our definition workspace.

The different windows, we just looked at that. We said we can drag things from the project into the definition workspace. Application development example here. In this course, you will add PeopleCode to the task application to enforce business rules and improve the user interface.

As you're familiarize yourself with this application, you'll answer the following questions. What edits or validations does it still need? And how can we make this application easier or more efficient for the user? So this will be one of the primary applications we'll be working within here. Says we can get to it from the PIA by going to the Navigator, set up training, training tasks, and the task table.

So let's just take a look at it in our training environment. If I come over here and minimize my Application Designer from my desktop, we're going to take the icon called T1B85701. When I double-click on this icon, it opens up my sign-in. And we're going to sign in as PTCODE with the password of PTCODE. And once we get signed in, we'll go over here to our Nav Bar over on the right-hand corner. Click on the Nav Bar, the compass-looking item on the Fluid banner.

I'll come down here and I'll click on the Navigator. That shows us our portal history. And from here, we'll go to Setup Training. And from Setup Training, I click on my training task. And the first thing we'll look at is this task table. This will be one of the components and pages we'll be looking at this week and modifying.

If I do a search on this task table, here you'll see the different roles. I'm going to select just the first task, task 1. And these are tasks that would need to be completed for PeopleSoft University. So maybe in this case, these tasks are going to be when we're creating a brand-new course for PeopleSoft, or maybe a new release of a course guide.

But here the task is a unique identifier, so that's going to uniquely identify what tasks we're working on, similar to like a project. And then you see the description of it. PeopleTools 1 Training Guide. And then we see a short description, PT Guide. Effort total hours. This basically we have a budget. So when we're creating this PeopleTools 1 Training Guide, the budget currently states that we can spend 1,200 hours to get this guide created.

Effort spent hours. So that means someone's been working on this task, and you can see that we got 115 hour spent. So keeping up with the amount of work that's being completed on this task-- the number of hours anyway. Here you see the start date. What's the first date available for this task to be started on? And end date. It hasn't been completed, so I guess it could be a forecasted completion date, but it could also be marked when we finish it.

Task data. So this one says, is it unassigned, assigned, started, or completed? This one's been marked as saying it's already completed. Man, did we do good on this task. We budgeted 1,200 hours, and we only spent 115. Woo-hoo! In the money, baby. Well, in reality this application has some opportunities.

So we may not be in the money as well as we think, because things are actually not getting calculated correctly. One of the things that you'll notice in here, we have a start day and we have an end date. If I come over to the end date, let's say I'm going to end this on 1998. So on June 23, 1998, we're starting it on 2001, but we're going to end it in 1998. That don't make no sense. But notice if I hit Save here, it lets me do it. It says, hey, if that's what you want to do, we'll go with it.

Bad. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. Not a good thing. I'm going to change it back. So we might need to put some PeopleCode in here to validate these dates, start dates and end dates. In addition to that, if we come over here and look at effort spent, let's say I come in here. I'm going to say 1,800 hours. I'm going to say effort spent is 1,800.

And I've had this failed. Didn't give me no warning, no error. I have exceeded the hours budgeted by 600. Maybe if I was going to allow them to do this, I would want to give a warning message saying, hey, what are you thinking? We need manager approval to be able to do something like this. Or maybe what the other thought is, should a user be able to type in the effort spent hours? Probably not. We probably should have it calculated somewhere as the hours are being allocated, instead of being typed in here into a detailed table to keep up with this information.

Maybe I shouldn't be allowed to type in there at all. Maybe if it's completed, it should definitely be display only. But here you can see, we got some opportunities inside here. You got to hate it when something like that happens, right? So these are some of the things that we are going to be correcting as we go through the course.

In addition, I said, the details, where those details are coming from? Well, we have another application here. If I click back on my home on my Fluid banner, if I go to my Nav Bar, go to my Navigator, and go into my task resource and efforts. If I click on this one and I do a search, you'll see this is keyed by task. And you'll see we have a level zero and a level one, so this is a child of the task application. So you see it has the same high-level key with at least one additional key at the level one area.

So what are we doing here? Well, we're identifying the resources who are working on a task. So resources can assist with the guide. Maybe the technical writer could be a resource, an instructor who's going to be the one making sure the correct information is being taught and the guide is correct. Maybe it's the DDA who has to go out there and create the database for the environment, or the security officer who makes sure that the users can't get to anything other than what we want them to get to.

It could be many different people working on this, but with the guide, I think of the instructor. I think of the technical developer. There's many different people who might be playing a role in this. If we're creating the guide, we have to go test an environment. So who creates the environments? The database. So lots of different pieces.

If I look over here, you'll see the first thing you'll notice is Ed over here, Ed [? Kellenberger. ?] He's an instructor. And he's 50% available to be working on this. His phone number, and he's been finished with the task. And here we're keeping up with the detail. So Ed has assisted in working with this task on four different dates. He has put in the hours here, so you see we got-- he put in seven hours, he put in eight, and then he put in six, and he put in six. So what is that? He worked 27 hours on this, and he's finished with it.

But notice there's more rows of data. If I scroll through here, you also see we got Jim's worked on this. Jim was 100% available. He's not been marked as finished with what he needs to do, but the task says it's completed. And if I look through here, you see four different dates he's worked on it. So 10, 9 and 1/2, 10, 12, so he's worked what? 31.5 hours.

And if I look through here, you see we got Joe. Joe's worked on this. He's 100% available. Worked on three different dates, 16 and 1/2, 7, and 11 and 1/2. So what is that? 35 hours. And then if we look, we have Scott, Scott Sanchez. 25% available, worked on it three different times. 4 and 1/2 plus 3 plus 4. So he's put in 11 and 1/2 hours.

Well, we think about this right here. This right here is what? We said 27, 31 and 1/2, 35, and 11 or 11.5. That's roughly somewhere around 100-- 104.5 hours is what we said they've got working. But if I come back over here and let's say I go to my task application again, it says 115 hours that's been spent. And we said it's 104.5. There's a discrepancy here. Something's not right. So that's something we'll have to take a look at.

We need to set up some PeopleCode to get these in sync with each other. I come back over to my task resources and efforts that we have inside here, so maybe we'd like to know instead of me trying to add this stuff up. When we check the box saying they're finished, maybe we should give a total hours here where I don't have to try to count it myself. So again, we have some opportunities that we need to correct with some PeopleCode information.

And other things that we noticed, whether we fix it or not. I don't know. But we come over and notice over here on the task table, we have a place over here where you can say, assigned, unassigned, started, well, or completed. Well, here if we haven't assigned anybody yet, we shouldn't allow anyone to bill any hours to it. Other things we need to be thinking about.

So if we come back over here to our guide, and they're showing you some screenshots of these, talking about the eight steps of application development. So we know we have step one, plan the application. What is it we need to do? And in this class, our application is already created for us. But someone didn't plan out the PeopleCode too well, or the business rules. So we need to go out there and make some changes.

Defining fields. We'll have to define some fields later on in this course, but when we defining fields, we're defining the attributes of a field. A field could be used to create a column and a table, or it could be to allocate memory locations in a program. Defining records. Records are typically a blueprint for creating a SQL table, but we'll say that we can create other records in here that is used for holding fields for memory allocation. So we'll look at that as well.

Building a table, usually the most forgotten step. If you create a SQL table, you need to build it or it's not in the database yet. Defining pages. So pages is the user interface, what they see. A page is made up of levels, and levels refer to record fields. Defining components is what we execute, so components are made up of pages. It's a [? wrapper ?] [? of ?] pages. We tell it what actions we want on that component to be allowed, information such as search records that to build search pages, search page options as well.

We register the component. Registering the component places it into the portal registries, grants authorization to a permission list to have access to it, and puts it on a menu in the Application Designer. And then we test, test, and retest. And as you've just seen, somebody didn't do the testing, because we got all kinds of opportunities we're going to have to fix.

So that's going to bring you to your first activity, activity one, reviewing the PeopleSoft application development process. In this activity, you'll review the activity overview and review the eight sets of application development using the Training Tasks application as an example.
