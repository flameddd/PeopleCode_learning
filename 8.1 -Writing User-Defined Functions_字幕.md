Lesson eight, writing user-defined functions. Our objectives-- by the end of this lesson, you'll be able to write external user-defined functions, declare user-defined functions, call user-defined functions, define functions using parameters, and define functions using the returns calls. User-defined functions. PeopleCode supports three types of user defined functions. We have internal user-defined functions, or PeopleCode. This is a PeopleCode that is written in the program that's going to use it.

It doesn't require any declaration, but it cannot be called from any other location. It's only going to be able to be used in that internal program. We have external user-defined functions, and this is written in PeopleCode. This is created in a derived work record, and it must be declared. And it can be called from anywhere.

And then, we have external non-PeopleCode functions. These are written in some other programming language, such as C or Java, and then they get loaded into a DLL, a Dynamic Link Library. And we have to declare the library. When it comes to this course, we will focus on external user-defined functions only inside here. Now, when we talk about our functions, part of what we probably are asking ourselves is, again going back to that old thing, location, location, location. Which way do I go-- internal user-defined, external user-defined, external non-PeopleCode?

These are things we have to think about. Maybe we want a process button to call something. A process button could be a field on a derived work record we put on a page. Where do we place the PeopleCode? Well, maybe sometimes pressing this process calls a query. But maybe other times, pressing the process calls an App Engine. If we code the PeopleCode on the derived work record field process, it is global and is always going to do the same thing.

Now, granted we could pass parameters to condition it inside the code. But by placing it as an external user-defined function, every time you call it, it's going to behave the same way. Where if we did an internal user-defined function, placing the logic on the component that needs it, we could write it to do what it needs to do based upon that component. So again, there's good and bad and multiple things you need to think about when setting this one up.

Using external functions-- follow these steps to use an external function in PeopleCode. Define the function typically in a function library. So you'll go out there and create a derived work record, and that derived work record will have the name of func lib in it. And we'll define that function. We'll say function, function name, any parameter list we want to pass in it.

We can also do returns to return a data type. But in the statements of what the function does, you can write the function with no parameters. You could write it with parameters. Or you can write it with returns. But when you're finished, you end the function with end function.

Once you've created the function, then you declare the function at the beginning of each program that wants to use it. So you'd say, declare function and then whatever the function name is, so you'd put in the name of the derived work record in a field name that contains the function. You'd put in that information inside. You'd tell it PeopleCode, and tell it the record field name inside that function you want to use.

And then the event that's going to have it. So you would be telling it where to go find that information when you're going in here and declaring the function. So you'd be saying, declare function whatever the name of the function is, then you'd say PeopleCode, and then you'd tell it the record name. That would be there derived work record and field name. And then, the event that it contains-- would normally be field formula.

And then, you would call the function. And you would pass whatever parameters are needed. I come over to our training environment here. When it comes to functions, functions are stored in derived work records. And if I come over and do a File, Open, and I say open a record, and if I type in func lib, you'll see that we have lots of records out here that start with func lib. That's the naming convention if we're going to be creating a function.

We put it in a derived work record that has the naming convention func lib something. And here, you see whatever it's going to be doing. So here, you see one called func lib add print, for example, inside here. I could go out here and click on this one right here. So this is-- actually it is an add print. This is addresses.

So if I come in here and I double click, I can open up that function. And you'll see that it has fields in it. And these fields, I've got an address one field, I've got an AR field, an AP field. Notice they are bold. They have PeopleCode on them. And most likely, there are going to be PeopleCode on field formula.

If I click on Show me My PeopleCode Display, sure enough, they're all three of them have PeopleCode on field formula. If I come in here, I can open up one of these, so let's open up the one called Address. If I double click on the checkbox on field formula, that should open it up. And there we go. Took it a few minutes to get it to open, but when I opened up this function that we have in here-- so the first thing you notice is, notice the first two lines are declare functions.

So you see declare function, get customer format. Declare function get vendor format. What could it all mean? Well, apparently this function that is being written is going to make use of other functions, existing functions that are out there. So you can see that we're creating a function that's going to be called get level two postal format, and this one's using a returns, returns a string.

But apparently, we're going to be using other functions within these functions that are in this derived work record field address. And they're going to be calling these other functions get customer format and get vendor format. Normally, when you're looking at these, these are variants of each other. So on this field, we have three different functions that are being defined in here.

We have a function get level two postal format. If you see we had the function, then we got the declaration of what it does, and we have end function. Then, have a look further down here, you see we got another one out here that is called check address panel. And you see the function, and sure enough, you have an end function.

And then, we see a third function being defined in here called function in it address panel returns Boolean. And here, you can see the declaration of what it's doing. So obviously, what we're looking at here, we can add more than one function being defined inside here. So we add more than one function. Again, they're usually derivatives of each other or some type of variant of each other, of what they're doing inside.

But this one has three functions that are being defined. And then, we would call that function somewhere when we want it to be executed. If I go ahead and I'll close this one up, and I'll close that. And when it comes to wanting to call a function, if I come over here, we've looked at a call of a function earlier. I could come over here and, let's say, let's do an open.

And I'm going to come in here and open up the student one. Actually, I could probably look at that over here on the records easier. I've already got it in my project. If I open up the BSU student table, here's an example of calling a function. If I go to my student IDs PeopleCode, here you see when I go to use the function, I have to declare the function.

So declare function assign student ID. And when I go to declare this, you see it says it's PeopleCode. And where are we going to find this function called assign student ID? We're going to find it in a derived work record called func lib PSU is the name of it. And then, it's going to be on a field called student ID.

And the function is defined on the field formula. So if I come in here, you can see, this is the function. We declare it first. We're saying if the student table is equal to new and the mode is equal to add, here's where we're calling that function. Assign student ID passing in the parameter of student ID.

And if I right click on here, I can open up that function. Notice, when I'm looking at this function. Where is it at? ITt's in a library called func lib and on a field called student ID. So here's where I can see the function information. And it's on the field formula. And this is where we see what it's doing.

On this particular one, we're setting up a variable called length and saying it's equal to six. We're doing an ampersand check variable. Repeat the nine for the length for six, basically, so nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine. Doing a SQL execs, select student ID last from the PS installation training table. And put it for last student, if the last student is where we're storing the information that we select.

If the last student plus one's value, if it's greater, if the last student plus one is greater than the value of the check, the nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, then give them an error message and tell them, that number is too big. Else the student ID is going to be equal to the last student that was read from the installation training table plus one.

Once we've done that, then we're going to do a SQL exec to update the PS installation training table to set the student ID last to be student ID last plus one. Increment it inside the table. So here's an example of showing this function, what it does. Again, if I wanted to open up that function over here, I could say FIle, Open up Record, just another way of doing it, the long method. And I could say look in the func lib_PSU.

And here, you'll notice we've got the field student ID, business unit, and order number. And in our code, we said that this was over on the student ID. And again, I could say, show me that PeopleCode. And sure enough, you see the same PeopleCode the field formula. When it comes to working with derived work records-- so here again, you put this-- functions are set up on the right, work records.

Derived work records basically have three purposes. We use derived work records for creating variables that maybe we want to display on a page. We've seen that earlier. We can also set it up to add fields that have programs on it. And then, the third one is fields that have functions. And this is an example of what we're looking at here is functions that are being used.

So we kind of looked at this as just another example here, but you've seen the syntax for function definitions. You have a function, the function name, and we can do a parameter list. Or we don't have to pass any parameters. That's optional. And you could have returns, to return a data type. And again, that is optional as well. You put in your whatever the function does, and you end it with end function.

Function declaration. When you want to use the function, you have to declare it. So to use an external PeopleCode function in a program other than the one where it is written, you must declare it at the beginning of the program. So here, you see we have Declare Function, whatever the function name is that you want to use. So for example, assign order number could be an example PeopleCode.

And then, you tell it the name of the derived work record that has the function dot the field name inside that derived work record that we're going to find the event on, and then what is the event that we want to be executing? And most of the time, it'll be field formula. So here, you see another example of using it. Here is on the purchase order header, we're declaring a function assign order number as PeopleCode that's found on the derived work record called Func Lib Education Services on a field called Order Number, and it's on the event called Field Formula.

And then when I get ready to use it, we tell it we put in the name of the function, Assign Order Number. And here, we have to pass the parameters of whatever the function is expecting. So if the function is expecting a parameter, we have to specify the parameters that it is expecting. So this is the output, the order number, in this case.

And here is talking about if we was going out and declaring an external non PeopleCode function. We don't do that in this training class, but you can also declare an external non-PeopleCode function, such as a Java function, in a Dynamic Link Library, a DLL, by defining it as a library function and supplying the location of the function.

So you can see PeopleSoft Online Help for more details. But here, you would say Declare Function, whatever the name of the function is that you created, Library, and then tell it the library name.
