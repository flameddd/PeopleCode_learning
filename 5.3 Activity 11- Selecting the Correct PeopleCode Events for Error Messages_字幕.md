Activity 11. Selecting the Correct PeopleCode Events for Error Messages. In this activity, you will review the activity overview, select the correct events in which to place PeopleCode to enforce three business rules.

Activity Overview. In this activity, you will write PeopleCode programs to address three business rules. The challenge will be to select the correct event for each requirement.

Consider the following points to assist you in deciding which events are applicable. When? Which PeopleCode event? When should the PeopleCode program execute? In other words, which PeopleCode event should be used? Sometimes more than one is required.

Where? Which PeopleCode Application Designer definition? Where should the PeopleCode programs be attached? Depending upon where the PeopleCode is placed and when the program needs to execute, the processing mode may need to be evaluated.

What? What is the program logic? What will the code look like? Notice that this is the last step. Once the first two questions have been answered, the logic is usually straightforward.

Complete the following customizations. On the Task Resources page, generate an error message if a resource is available more than 100% of the time. Important! Because the component is in deferred mode, the component processor will not recognize that PCT_AVAILABLE has been changed until the next server trip. You need to turn off deferred processing for the PCT_AVAILABLE field.

Generate an error message if the user tries to delete a resource from the Task Resources page if the resource has completed the task. And on the Tasks page, if a start date and an end date have been entered, generate an error message if the end date precedes the start date.

Activity Detailed Steps. Generating an Error Message for Greater Than 100% Availability. To generate an error message on the Task Resources page if a resource is available more than 100% of the time. Important! Because the component is in deferred mode, the component processor will not recognize that PCT_AVAILABLE has been changed until the next server trip. You need to turn off deferred processing for the PCT_AVAILABLE field.

To generate this error message, turn off deferred processing for PCT_AVAILABLE field. In Application Designer, we'll open the PSU_TASK_RESOURCES component. Open the Task Resoures. page. Double-click on the field PCT_AVAILABLE. Go to the Use tab, clear the Allow Deferred Processing checkbox, click OK, and click the Save button.

Then we can return to the PSU_TASK_RESOURCES component definition. Go to our Structure tab and set up our PeopleCode. So if I come over here to our Application Designer, I'm going to open up my Components, my PSU_TASK_RESOURCES component. And if I double-click on the page, if I go to my Percent Available and double-click on this page control, go to the Use tab, and if it's selected, deselect Allow Deferred Processing. Hit OK. And I'll hit Save. And I'll close my page.

If I go to my Structure tab, now I'll go down to my PSU_TASK_RESOURCES. I'll go to my Percent Available field, right-click and say show me the PeopleCode. And I'll hit the drop-down here. And I'm going to go into FieldEdit. And I'll write my code in this area. I'll say if, and I'll put my caret, and say greater than 100, then give an error, and I can say "Resource cannot be available more than 100%," and put my End-If.

Let's see how many typos I put in here. Hey, none! How about that? And I'll hit my Save. And that sets up the PeopleCode for this first piece.

I'll go ahead and go back over here to our guide. And the next step we have here, Generating an Error Message If User Deletes a Resource That Already Completed a Task. Generate an error message if the user tries to delete a resource from the Task Resources page if the resource has already completed the task.

To generate this error message, turn off deferred processing for the completed flag field, return to the PSU_TASK_RESOURCES page definition, view the page field properties for COMPLETED_FLAG, access the Use tab, clear the Allow Deferred Processing checkbox, click OK. Click the Save button. Go back to the Structure tab, a task resource component. And create your PeopleCode on the row delete.

So if we come back over here, and I'll close this. Go back to my definition, open up the page. Go to the field called Finish with Task, double click it, go to the Use tab and deselect the allowed for processing.

Hit OK. Hit my save. Close my page. Go back to my Structure tab, and I'll right click on the task resource and say, view PeopleCode.

And I'll choose the event this time called row delete. And I'll put in my logic. I'll say if my completed flag is equal to y, because again, it's inside the record, I don't have to put in the record name first. I'll say then, and I'll say error. And I'll say resource and not be deleted if finished with the task in def. And I'll save it, looking good, looking good.

Go back over here to our guide. It says generate an error message when the end date precedes the start date on the task page. To generate this error message, open up the task component, select the Structure tab, and set it up on the Save edit.

So if I come over here, I can close this component, expand my components, open up my PSU_TASK. And if go to my Structure tab, I can come in here and right click on my PSU_TASK_TBL and say, view the people code. Go to save edit. Don't need to do anything with deferred processing. Save edit deferred processing does not affect.

And here I could say, if, and I could say, all. And I could say check to see if there's a value in my start date and end date fields. So I can drag it from my record. So I could come over here and go to my task table.

And I could say, let's grab the start date, drop it in here, comma. And I can say, grab my end date, drop it in here. Of course, I could have did it before just typing in the table names in here.

And I'm going to say, if my start day is greater than my end date, then I'll say error. And I'll say, start date must precede end date, end def.

Check how many typos I got, looking good so far. I'll save it. Come back over here to our guide.

Testing your program, so the test your program test availability greater than 100%. To test the availability check in the browser, sign into the PeopleSoft system as PT code PT code if you're not already signed in.

Go to Setup training, training task, tasks resource and efforts, and select task 1. Change availability for Ed Kellenberger to greater than 100%, for example, 110%. Tab to the next field, and you should get an opportunity.

If we come in here and go to our PIA. Go to our nav bar, go to our navigator, go to setup training and go to training tasks, tasks resources and efforts. If I do a search, select task 1.

Ed Kellenberger, I'm going to say 110% and tab out of my field. And I should get my opportunity. Resource cannot be available more than 100%. I hit OK and go back to our guide.

So we did get the message. It says, testing, deleting a row for a resource marked as complete. Change of availability for Ed Kellenberger back to 50%. So click the button Alt 8 to delete the row. Delete confirmation is displayed. Click OK. Notice the error message.

So if come back over here, change this back to 50%. Now that looks good. So now if I come over and say, let's be done with you, Ed, and I hit the delete, it says, delete the currently selected row from this page. I say, OK.

And it says, resource cannot be deleted if finished with a task. So there's our opportunity message that we've seen. So that's a good thing. Hit OK, come back over here, And again, you see they're showing you that you should have got the message.

Testing an end date that precedes a start date. The tests having an end date that precedes the start date, go back into training task, task table. Change either the start date or the end date so that the end date precedes the start date and click Save.

So if we come back over here and say I returned a search. And I'm going to go to my nav bar, go to my Navigator, go to my task table, and preloaded my task 1 because it was in the buffer. Here if I come in here and let's say we change this start date to say that we're going to start this class in 2011 and finish it in 2002. Sounds good to me, right?

I hit Save. And I get an opportunity. Start date must precede the end date. I'll hit OK. And again, that's the error message we should have. This concludes the activity. Please do not continue.
