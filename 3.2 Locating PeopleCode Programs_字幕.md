PeopleCode programs are associated with the combination of two items-- a PeopleSoft application designer definition and an event. Each definition type has an event set, that is, a group of events appropriate to the definition type. Events are pre-defined exit points either in the component process or flow or in the program flow for messages, component interfaces, or application engine programs. As each event is encountered, the PeopleCode program associated with the definition in an event executes. And a definition can have 1 or 0 PeopleCode programs for each event in it's event set.

You can associate PeopleCode programs with the following definitions. Within the component processor flow, components, including the component itself, component records, and component record fields. Menus, menu items and pop-up menus only, pages, and record fields. Outside the component processor flow we can associate PeopleCode with application engine programs, application packages within application classes, component interfaces in messages. We attach PeopleCode to definitions.

So we focus on three things when we're talking about doing PeopleCode. You add the when, the where, and the what. So those are the three things we're looking at. The first thing I typically look at is the where, location. As I'm sure you heard it said when you were taking economics that location, location, location. Location is everything, baby.

So when we talk about location, where do we need to put our PeopleCode? Do we place the PeopleCode on the component itself? Do we place it on a component record or a component record field? Or do we put it on a record field? So again, the first thing is the where.

The next thing you would ask yourself is the when. When do I need this to execute? And when we say when, I'm talking about the event. So an event is a pause in the execution in the component processor where you can have your own code be executed.

And the last app is the what. And the what is the syntax. And in my opinion, once you learn PeopleCode, syntax is probably the easiest part of it because you pretty well I've already got an idea of what you want it to do.

Now, of course, during this course, it may not be the easiest part because you're just learning the syntax. But those are the three things. We've got to ask ourselves where, when, and what.

Most of the time we'll code on a component, especially in this class. And the reason for a component would be that it's got the smallest global impact. So when I'm setting it at a component, it's only going to affect that one component.

Where when you start setting it up at a record field location, it's going to affect everywhere possibly that that record field is being utilized. And of course, you might have 50 different components using that record field. So by putting it at the component, you are only affecting the one. But now of course, sometimes you want it at a record field because it's going to be something global that you always want it to occur no matter what the application is that is running it.

Record fields, before discussing record field PeopleCode, you should understand the differences between fields, record fields, and component record fields. Fields are standalone definitions whose attributes are shared across all records that use the field. So fields are again, standalone definitions whose attributes are shared across all records that use the field.

We can't set PeopleCode at the field level. We can't do that. We can set it at the component record field or the record field. When we say record field, record fields are owned by the record definition that include them. So it's only going to affect anywhere that record field is being utilized.

Where if we could do it at the field level, that could affect all the different records that use the field. But again, with PeopleCode, the lowest level we have is record field. And we can also set it at that component record field. Component record fields are owned by the component definition that include them. Component record fields appear in the structure view of a component.

PeopleCode programs can be placed on record fields and component record fields. Record field PeopleCode, you can access record field PeopleCode programs in several ways. In a record definition in the project workspace, double click on an event named to open the PeopleCode program. Right click a field name in the record definition and project workspace or in the definition workspace and choose view PeopleCode.

In a record definition in the definition workspace like the PeopleCode display button on the toolbar, then double click the intersection of a field row or in an event column, in a record definition in the definition workspace like a field and view PeopleCode from the main menu. From a page definition in a definition workspace, right click in a field and select view record PeopleCode.

So if we come back over here to our training environment for a moment and go back to our Application Designer, just take a look at some of these different methods that we have of getting to the PeopleCode when it comes to record field PeopleCode.

I'm going to do a Control F7. And I'm going to insert a record into my project called the PSU student table. And when I look at this PSU student table, if I expand my records in my project, whoop, there it is. And if I expand the PSU student table, notice you see some of these fields that are in this record have a plus sign beside them. And if I expand the plus sign, you will see the PeopleCode that is attached to it.

So in the case of same address as customer, we have two programs on this record field. We have rowinit program and field change program. And I could double click on one of these. If I double click on rowinit that will open up the PeopleCode for that record field for that one event called rowinit.

Or I could come over here and I could open up the record, the PSU student table. And anytime I see a field that is in bold, that means that record field has PeopleCode. So if I come over to same address as customer, if I right click on here I could say, show me the PeopleCode. And if I click on it, that opens up our PeopleCode.

Or still yet another method that I could use to access PeopleCode. If I come over here on my toolbar for record field, notice over here, we have an icon called PeopleCode display. And if I click on the PeopleCode display, that shows me all the different events, all the different programs that we have that's out here. So there's four programs on the record PSU student table in this case. And if I come over here on one of these programs and double click on the chat box, that opens up the PeopleCode.

Now, once I have PeopleCode open, I could also hit the dropdown here. And I'd see all the record fields that have PeopleCode. I could tag select a record field from here. And once I've selected a record field, you'll see over on the right dropdown where I could select a PeopleCode event, look at the PeopleCode program that's on it.

So this is showing you what we just looked at. Lightning bolts indicate PeopleCode. And I don't know if I actually showed that, but I will in just a moment. Component PeopleCode, component PeopleCode is associated with a component definition in an event. To access PeopleCode associated with a component in the project workspace, right click a component's name and choose the PeopleCode.

Alternatively, on a component definition in a definition workspace, you can select a Structure tab. A component that has associated component PeopleCode will display a lightning bolt symbol next to the name. Select a component name, right click and select view PeopleCode from the pop-up menu that appears. If PeopleCode editor appears, that component has associated PeopleCode. Then the first program in the component event set will appear in the editor.

So if we come over here and take a look at this, I'm going to go back to my training environment. Notice over there on the record, I'm going to look at it first because I don't know if I pointed it out or if I didn't. But if I expand my student table, notice when I expand student ID where you see the plus sign, there's your lightning bolt on the record field.

If I come over here, I'm going to do a File Open. And I'm going to open up a different object. I'm going to open up a component called PSU_CUST. And if I look at this component, there are a couple ways I could get the PeopleCode. I could come over here and say view. And I could say, show me the PeopleCode. Whoop, there it is.

Or another method is, I could come over here to the Structure tab. And here you see, anywhere you see a lightning bolt would indicate there is a PeopleCode program. So here you see there's one on the PSU_CUST component itself as I view PeopleCode and there it is.

Component record PeopleCode, in addition to PeopleCode attached to the component itself, PeopleCode can be attached to a component record and event. To access PeopleCode associated with a component record, open the component definition. In the definition workspace like the Structure tab, expand the structure of the component definition to display the contents of the scrolls. Component record that has associated PeopleCode will display a lightning bolt symbol next to the name.

Select a component record name. Right click and say, do PeopleCode from the pop up menu that appears. So if we take a look at this, if I come over here and let's say I do a File open, and I'm going to say, component. And I am going to say, let's open up PSU_EMP review.

And if I take a look at this component, if I go to my Structure tab, and notice over here where you see PSU_EMP review reviewer, this record, this is component record PeopleCode. So I can see it has component record code here. And here you see review type. This is component record field PeopleCode.

So when I'm looking at PeopleCode, we've seen earlier over here when I opened up the student table, we've seen that we can add PeopleCode at a record field layer. When I'm looking at it at a record field, you can have up to 15 different events that can have PeopleCode. So here you see up to 15 events that would show up inside here.

When I'm taking a look at the component PeopleCode, if I come back over here and take a look at that PSU_CUST, and I hit the dropdown right here, you'll see there's five events for component PeopleCode. And if I come back over here and look at this PSU_EMP review, if I come back over here and look at this one-- I thought I was already in here, but maybe I exited out-- here you see component record PeopleCode.

If I look at the PeopleCode here with component record PeopleCode, you can have either seven or nine events. Nine would be if it's used as a search record you have a search init and search say. If it's not as a search record, then you would see seven events being listed here. And then you see we also have component record field PeopleCode. And with component record field PeopleCode, if I looked over here on events, you'll see there's four events for component record field.

When I'm looking at PeopleCode, some of the things that you might remember from when you were in your Tools 2 class, some of the things you can reference here, if I wanted to reference this field student ID in my PeopleCode, I could put in a caret here. And I could say, caret is going to be equal to, and I could say maybe one, two, three, four.

And if I hit my validate, let me do it up here. I want to do it right here. If I come in here and I say, caret right here, when I go to do my validate inside here, you see it puts in the record field day. So you might recall that from Tools 2.

Caret says, whatever record field you're currently on. I was on the student ID. If I wanted to reference something inside this record, remember I could just come in here and type in the field name in here. So I can say STUDENT_NAME equals Greg is great.

So if I was wanting to reference a field that we have inside here, I could just type-- apparently putting that-- oh, I see why. They don't have their semicolon. Let's try that. There you go.

So I get references inside here. I didn't look at the code they had. But you could just reference the name inside the record. As long as that name is inside the record, here you see it is, you can just type it in. Or another option you have is, so long as it's inside your buffer, you could come over here and put in the field, just drag and drop.

So I could say, customer ID is equal to C-O-N-S. So you can drag it from your project workspace. So some of the things that we went over and learned inside our Tools 2 class. And each line should end in a semicolon out here. I'm not going to save any of this. So let me get rid of that.

And if we come back over here, so talking about our component record. Component record field PeopleCode, I just mentioned that one in addition to PeopleCode, attached to the component and component record, PeopleCode can be attached to a component record field in an event. To access PeopleCode associated with a component record field, open up the component definition in the definition workspace, like the Structure tab.

Expand the Structure tab of the component's definition to display the contents of the scroll. Expand the results in the scroll to display the component record fields. The component record field that has associated PeopleCode will display a lightning bolt symbol next to the name. Select the component record field name, right click, and say, View PeopleCode from the pop up. And we just looked at that.

Page PeopleCode to access PeopleCode associated with a page. In your project workspace, highlight the page name, right click it. Select view PeopleCode. Alternatively on the page definition in workspace, you can right click any part of the definition name and select view page PeopleCode.

So page PeopleCode doesn't show up with any lightning bolts that you see over here in App Designer in the project workspace or in a structure. But if I come over here and open up a page, if I say, open up PSU_PIE_CHART, this would be an example. If I right click, and here I'm going to say, show me page PeopleCode. There's only one event in page PeopleCode and that is called activate. And it gets executed every time the page gets focused.

PeopleCode Editor, any method of accessing the PeopleCode program opens up the PeopleCode editor. On the left hand side of the editor window is a dropdown with a list of definitions within the current high level definition, the component, the record page, or application package.

Select the list to see all available definitions. Any definition with PeopleCode will be bold. On the right side of the editor is a dropdown list of events currently selected. You go to there, you can see all the events that are eligible for that definition type. Any event that's in bold means there is PeopleCode on it. And then we just looked at that. And that's what they're showing you here in this screenshot.

So over here on the left, you can hit the dropdown to see the definition list for whatever definition you have open. Over on the right, you see the event list. And anything in either one that is bold means there is PeopleCode.

PeopleCode editor features, the editor has built in capabilities. It formats the code, including indents, spaces, and capitalizations when you save. We've just seen that. It validates the syntax and display errors. We've seen that as well.

Expand short field names and short application class names to fully qualified names. Color codes the elements of the program. And you can change that color coding. So if I'm in here and I'm looking at this, you see like keywords are in blue and such.

If I come over here to my Edit, you see display font and colors. And this is where you set up the information. So here you can see, I put my quota strings in that color, key words in this, comments in this.

I think that's green. I'm color blind so it don't much make a difference to me but. It backs up every key stroke of your program. And in your activity, you'll see that. It's usually a temp directory you set up to back it up to.

PeopleCode editor includes these additional features that supports dragging and dropping definitions from the project workspace or another definition window or text from another editor window. It enables you to open any definition or view PeopleCode in any definition referenced in the current program by right clicking the definition.

It provides an Autocomplete feature for PeopleCode application classes, building classes, built-in functions, system variables and constants and provides context sensitive help for any PeopleCode built-in function, system variable, meta-SQL, function, methods, and properties of built-in classes and certain deliberate application classes.

So if I'm over here, and I'm like, well, what does that do? Percent mode, well, if you hit F1, this will open up the context sensitive help to tell you what that does. You gotta love it. Activity 2, Using the PeopleCode Editor. In this activity, you will review the activity overview and try out several features of the PeopleCode editor.
