Activity 12, Calculating and Displaying Derived Values. In this activity, you'll review the activity overview. Then enhance the Training Tasks application to calculate and display the effort to go on the Task page. And display the resource status on the Task Resource page.

Activity Overview-- in this activity, you will use derived work fields to calculate and display values that would not normally be stored in the database. Calculate and display the effort to go on the Task page. Display the resource status on the Task Resource page. Calculating and displaying the effort to go on the Task page.

Currently, the Task page displays the total effort required and effort spent to date for a task. Using these two fields, calculate the effort to go as the difference between these two fields, and display it on the task page. Model the new field on the data characteristics of the existing fields used in the calculation.

Test your application thoroughly. Select Setup, Training, Training Task, Task Table in the browser, and determine which actions the user or system might take that would require the value to be calculated or recalculated.

Test for all possible combinations of the total effort required in efforts fields. Displaying the resource status of the Task Resource page, we're going to assign a resource status to each of the resources working on a task. The status for each resource must be determined when the page is first displayed and whenever the user changes the resource's availability. Resource status should be based on the percentage of time the resource has available to work on the task.

The following chart illustrates that the resource statuses are based on a range of values for resource percent availability. Here, we see 100% would mean fully available. 50% to 99% would be semi-available. 25% to 49% is part time. 1% through 24% is occasional, and 0 would mean they are not available.

Use recommended PeopleSoft application design principles for constructing this resource status field, meaning we're going to create a field with translate values. Try using an Evaluate construct to assign the value for this field. You could use an If statements, but I would recommend and Evaluate statement. Test your application thoroughly. Select Training Task, Task Resources and Efforts. Verify that the initial value displayed when the page is first displayed is correct. Then test different values in the Percent Available field.

Activity Detailed Steps-- perform the detailed steps to complete the activity. Calculating and Displaying the Effort to Go on the Task Page-- perform the following steps. Create an Effort to Go field as a signed number with four digits to the left and one digit to the right of the decimal point, similar to the definitions for effort spent and effort total.

So if we come over here to our Application Designer, close whatever the last thing you had open. And I'll say File, New Field, and we'll say that this one is going to be a signed number. We'll say that its [INAUDIBLE] is going to be four integer positions and one decimal position. And we'll go to our label identifier, and we'll give this a name. We'll call this one EFFORT-- how about TO_GO. Then we'll give it a long name, and we'll say Effort to Go.

And I'll save it. And I'll save this as EFFORT_TO_GO. And hit OK. Step two, create a record definition name DERIVED_TRAIN. Add the EFFORT_TO_GO field to the DERIVED_TRAIN. Set the record type to Derived Work Record. Note you will be unable to build a derived work record.

So I come over here to App Designer. I'll say, File, New, and we'll say Record. I'll expand my fields, and I'll grab my EFFORT_TO_GO, drag it into my record definition, go to my Record Type tab, and here, I'll say, make this one a derived work record. And I'll hit Save. And we'll save this as DERIVED_TRAIN.

And I'll save everything, and I'll close what I have created so far. Come back over here. Step four, put the DERIVED_TRAIN EFFORT_TO_GO field on the PSU Task page. In the Page Field Properties, select the Display Zero checkbox. Otherwise, the system will not display a zero value. And make the field Display Only, so if we come back over here to our App Designer, and if I go to my Pages, and we open up our Task page, and I'm going to make my frame a little bit bigger here, like so.

And I'll go and expand my records, expand my DERIVED_TRAIN, and I'll go to my EFFORT_TO_GO, and I'll drop it in here somewhere about like this. And I'll double click on it, and we'll go over here to the Use tab. We'll say, make this one a display only field. And on the Record tab, I'll say Display Zero. And I'll hit OK. And I'll hit Save.

Let's see the next thing we have here. Make the Effort Spent and Effort Total fields interactive, or display the Refresh button on the page. To make a field interactive, clear the Allow Deferred Processing checkbox on the Use tab in the Page Build Properties dialog box.

To enable to Refresh button, select the Refresh Checkbox on the Interactive tab of the Component Properties dialog box. So whichever way you want to go with it, if I come over here and go to my Effort Spent, I'll double click on it. And I could go to the Use, and I could say-- deselect Allow Deferred Processing.

I'll go to my Effort Total and double click on it. Go to Use, and I'll deselect Allow Deferred Processing. And I'll hit my-- I'm going to hit the 1-2, to make sure my tab sequence is good. And I'll hit Save, and hit OK on the message. It's referring to these must have something out of order in them.

The other method I could have done is I could have come over to the component and opened up the task, went to my properties, went over here to my Internet tab, and I could have just checked the box that says, give me a Refresh button. And I've chosen to do both of them.

Step number six, create your PeopleCode program in the following three locations. So we'll need to set this up on our PSU Task component. And we'll set it up on the Task table RowInIt event. We'll also set this up on our Task table Effort Spent field change and our Effort Total field change.

So we come over here to our Application Designer, and I'm going to go to my structure and device scroll-- or expand to scroll, and go to my Task table. I'm going to right click and say, View PeopleCode. And I'm going to choose my event inside here. I'll go to my RowInIt event, and set up my logic of what I want to do.

I'm going to come over here to my records, my DERIVED_TRAIN and drag my EFFORT_TO_GO over here onto my page. And I'll say, this is going to be equal to, and I'll say, this is equal to my EFFORT_TOTAL minus my EFFORT_SPENT. And I'll hit my Validate. Lookin' pretty.

So I've got this, and same code I'll need on three different events, so I'm just going to copy this. And I'll go in here and go to my Record field in the component. I'll go to my EFFORT_TOTAL. And I'll go to my Field Change. Paste this in. And similarly, I'll go to my EFFORT_SPENT and go to my Field Change, and paste this in. And I'll hit my Save.

Once we've got that, we'll come back in here and go back in here to our guide. It says to test your application, select the Recent Places Task table in the browser, or you can go back to the Navigator, Setup Training, Training Task, Task Table. Ensure that the initial EFFORT_TO_GO value is calculated correctly. Enter the values for the total effort and effort spent to see if the EFFORT_TO_GO value gets recalculated correctly.

And our equal values for the TOTAL_EFFORT and TOTAL_SPENT EFFORT_TO_GO calculations should be zero in values where effort spent is greater than total effort. So if we come in here and take a look at this, we go back into our PIA, and we'll click on Home.

And if I go to my Task table, if I do a search, and I select Code 1 or Task 1 here, you see effort total is 1,200. Effort spent is 480, and 720 is the correct amount. So that looks like it's working correctly.

If I come over and change effort total hours to be 1,500 and tab out, notice it changed the EFFORT_TO_GO. It says, 1,020. If I come over-- and that looks correct-- if I change this to be 500, changes the EFFORT_TO_GO to be 1,000. Looking good. Looking good.

If I come over here, and I say, let's take in-- this is 1,500, and I say, let's make this one 1,500, and tab out, now it's equal to zero. So you're just showing us the results of when you first come in.

Displaying the Resource Status on the Task Resource Page-- to display a resource status on the Task Resource page, we're going to create a field name, Resource Status, with a length of 1 and a type of character. And if I come over here, I'll close all this. And I'll say File, New Field, Character 1, and we'll name this one Resource Status. And I'll let the short name default to the same thing.

Come back over here. It says, enter these translate values. So 4 will be fully available, 3 semi-available, 2, part time, 1, occasional, 0, not available. So if I come back to my Application Designer, and if I go into my Properties, if I go to my Translate Values, here I can click on Add to add my values. So I'll come in here, and I'll say 4. And I want to make these always available, so I'll say 01/01/1901. And I'll say this one is fully available.

I'll hit OK. I'll add three, and I'll say this one is going to be semi-available. I'll hit Add again. I'll say 2. I'll say as part time. I'll hit Add again. I'll put in 1. And we'll say it's occasional. And I'll hit Add again, and I'll say 0, which will be not available.

I'll hit OK. I'll hit OK. And I'll hit Save, and I'll name this one Resource Status. Come back over here to our guide here. Add the Resource Status field to the DERIVED_TRAIN derived work record. On the Record Field Properties Edit tab, set the table edit type to be translate.

And it should come in automatically, but if we come over here and open up our record, DERIVED_TRAIN, and I go to my fields and grab my resource status, and drag it over here, I double click on the resource status. On the Edit, it comes in with a translate table automatically.

I'll hit Save. Add the DERIVED_TRAIN Resource Status field to the PSU Task Resource page. Insert the field as a dropdown list box. In the Page Field Properties on the Record tab, select the Xlat Long option. Make the field display only, and verify the field is at level 1 in the page order.

So if we come back over here to our Application Designer and go back to our pages, and open up our Task Resource page, and we want to put that-- I'll put it to the right of my percent available. So I'll go and expand my DERIVED_TRAIN, grab my resource status, and I'll drop it in here, something like this right here.

And maybe I'll try to line it up a little better. Make sure I've got that lined up still. So once I've got the resource status filled in here, if I double click on it, you see it's a dropdown list box. If I double click on this field, we said, just use the long name, which means I'm probably going to have to rearrange it. I'll go to my Use, and make it display only. I'll hit OK.

And sure enough, I'll have to move it around some more, since I have-- this time, I'll line it up on the bottom edges. That don't look right. I'll hit my 1-2 and go to my Order tab, and just make sure it's occurring at the right location. So if I look at this, you can see-- where is it? There it is-- resource status. You see right now it is occurring at level 1, and it is looking good, I must say.

So I'll go ahead and hit my Save. Go back over here to our guide. Check the definition for the Percent Available field. Ensure that this field is defined as interactive, and select the Display Zero checkbox. Otherwise, the system will not display a zero value.

So if we come back over here to our App Designer, and Percent Available, if I double click on it, we're going to go and Display Zero. And Use-- we'll make sure that is running interactive. And I'll hit my OK. Hit my Save. Come back over here to our guide.

Now create your PeopleCode program in the following two locations. We'll use RowInIt to be able to make sure we can display the correct information from the Translate table when we're first coming in from in Inquiry mode, and we'll also set up code on field change in case a user changes the value. So if we come over here, and I'm going to close my page.

And I'll open up my component, my Task Resource component. I'll go back to my Structure tab, and I'll go into my Task Resources. And I'll right click and say, show me that PeopleCode. And I'll come in here and choose my RowInIt for when I'm first coming in on this. And I'll set up my logic.

So I'm going to do an evaluate statement. I'll say, Evaluate, and I'll say my percent available. I'll say when 0-- we'll say, set the DERIVED_TRAIN's resource status to be equal to 0. And we'll do a break. When 100, I'll say, set my DERIVED_TRAIN resource status to be equal to 4. We'll do a break.

Say, when greater than or equal to 50, we'll set the derived education training-- or DERIVED_TRAIN resource status. Now I'll say, make this one equal to 3. And we'll do a break. When greater than or equal to 25, we'll say, set the DERIVED_TRAIN resource status to be equal to 2. Do a break. And if it's not one of those, we'll do a When Other, and we'll say, set the DERIVED_TRAIN resource status to be equal to 1.

And we'll do an End Evaluate. And check how many typos I got. Oh, it looks like I didn't get any. Again, this is so unusual. I'll go ahead and copy this, and I'm also going to need to do this on my field change event from our percent available. Save it.

And now time to test our application. From Recent Places, select Task Resources and Efforts. Ensure that the initial resource status is displayed correctly. Change the percent available value so that each condition is tested. Change the percent available to 110%. Resource status is not updated.

And if we take a look at this, if I come back over, we'll see if this is going to be working. I'll click on Home. If I go back to my nav bar, Navigator, go back into my Task Resource and Efforts. Do a search. If I select my Task 1, it says here my percent available. Still don't have that lined up very good. I'll have to move that up. It says my percent available is 50, which means it is semi-available.

If I come in here and take a look at it, 100, you're fully available. 100-- fully available. 25 is part time. If I came in here and set it up to be 0, not available. And if I said 110, notice it got the error, but it didn't change the status. Cool. Exactly what we wanted it to do.

And if we come back over here, give it a screenshot showing at 50, it should say semi-available. This concludes the activity. Please do not continue.
