functions. The Substring function extracts a substring from a string beginning at a particular starting position and for a specified length. So the syntax for a substring, you have substring, source string that you want to work against, the starting position, and the length. We have an example in the student notes that I have rewritten up here to make it easier to read.

Let's say, for example we have in the Student Name field, in the Student table, it says Swenson comma Gregory. And then if we look at this code, we've declared some variables here. We had said local string, first name, and last name, locally integer comma position, and length. And then in our code here, we're saying CommaPos equals. And we're saying do a find, look for the comma inside the PSU_Student_Table.Student_Name.

So if we're looking out here for the comma in here, and our data currently is saying Swenson comma Gregory, then it would say-- you would find the comma and let's see, S-W-E-N-S-O-N, comma. So that is position number eight is where it would find the comma position.

Then we would say length. And we'd say length equals. And then we use another function called length of PSU_Student_Table.Student_Name.

So the student name is maybe a length of 15. So it looks out here to see how long is the values that are in here so we can count that up. But it should be about 15, I believe. Yep, 15.

And then here you see last name is equal to-- and now we're doing a substring. Substring, take PSU_Student_Table.Student_Name. starting in position number one and go for the length of comma position minus 1. We say the comma position was an 8. So 8 minus 1 is 7.

So we're saying take last name, and starting in position one, let's store this inside-- or the last name's going to be starting in position one. So starting with S, and for a length of seven. So we come up with Swenson.

Then it says first name. First name is equal to substring of the Student_Table.Student_Name and comma position at plus 1 for a length of length minus comma position. So when we look at this one, we see that for the first name, we're saying go to Swenson comma Gregory, use to comma position, which was eight, so starting in position number nine.

And go for the ampersand length, which was what we said was 15 minus the comma position. So 15 minus 8 is 7. So if we look at here, so this is going to pull out the information Gregory.

And then WinMessage first name-- so it's going to display a message to the screen that's going to say "first name is Gregory." And then we're going to concatenate that with a space and then concatenate that with the last name Swenson. And, of course, we'd get an OK button with the style of zero.

If we look here, it talks about Right Trim and Left Trim. Right Trim and Left Trim functions trim characters specified in the trim string from the right or left of a source string. Note that the trim string parameter is a list of characters not a character string. So when I'm looking at it, it's right trim string and in the trim string or left trim string in the trim string.

The Right Trim function returns a string value after scanning the string from right to left. If the character is a part of the character list, it is deleted. If it is not part of the list, the scanning process stops.

Left trim is identical to right trim except for it scans from left to right. If the character list is omitted, it's using a space is assumed. That is, trailing or leading blanks are what's going to get trimmed.

We come back over here and take a look at an example down here. Let's say in this example we have ampersand result equals right trim Student_Name "XYZ." And if we're looking at this right here, if we're saying that we want to trim the characters X, Y, Z-- and let's say that the Student_Name value is over here. So the Student_Name is 1 is equal to Jones Susan X, what is going to be trimmed from the following name?

Well, in this first example, it would trim out-- the X would be removed. So let me put an uppercase X. If I look at the next one, it would trim the Y. The uppercase Y it would be removed. And if I look at the next one, we would see that it would remove the X and Z would be removed from it.

If we look at the next one, Jones comma Susan ZZ, so in this case, it's going to remove the ZZ. And then the last one, Jones comma Susan XYCZ, what is going to get removed? It's going to come in here and it's going to remove just the Z.

So what happens when you're using this right trim, in this case, to remove the character X, Y, and Z, even though that last one had Jones, Susan XYCZ, the first time it comes to character there's not to be trimmed is where it stops. So it trimmed the Z off, and it said, hey, C's not part of that set, so it stops the trimming. So it's starting from the far right of the string, removing any X, Y, or Z characters until it finds any character that is not either X, Y, or Z, and then it stops.

String functions continued. We add the Find function. Find function returns the starting position or a number of a string within a string. If the string is not found, zero is returned. So here you see find, string within a string, and the number. We looked at that one in my last example.

The length Len function returns the length of a string including all leading and trailing spaces. We also looked at that one as well. It's going to return a numeric value of the length of the string.

Built-in functions for Fluid Applications. You need to keep in mind that existing PeopleCode items, including built-in functions can be used in fluid applications. Certain new PeopleCode items are not for fluid-- are for fluid applications only. So they are only for fluid applications.

And the descriptions of these new PeopleCode item specific for fluid applications, a note indicates that the item is to be used within fluid applications only. The built-in functions specific for fluid applications are listed in the documented-- in the Fluid User Interface Developer's Guide. It's also listed in the PeopleCode API Reference and the PeopleCode Language Reference Guide.

So here it's showing an example. We have one that is for a fluid called IsFluidMode. It returns a Boolean value indicating whether Fluid Mode is enabled on the specified component. If neither optional parameter is specified, then the function operates on the current component. So IsFluidMode, and you sell it the component, Component_Name market. And, of course, it's going to return back either it's on, true, 1, or it's not on, off.

Another example would be AddStyleSheet. So this would be to add a style sheet, like a custom style sheet, that has your custom style classes in it. If we came back over to our training environment, and let's say I opened up my online help guide again, and this time I'm going to do a search in here. If I do that search, and I want to say I want you to go out here and search for AddStyleSheet, here it says, this is where we found the AddStyleSheet. So PeopleCode built in functions and language constructs as part of the PeopleCode Language Reference Guide.

If I click on this, and if it takes me to this location, and if I scroll down here to the AddStyleSheet and expand it, here you see the syntax to use this AddStyleSheet, style sheet, style sheet name. And it tells you a description. Add the style sheet function to add a free form style sheet to an HTML document for the page or component. But the thing that where I'm pointing out here is we have the important use this function within fluid applications only.

Identifying other built-in functions. We have the use the AddToDateTime function to add the specified number of years, month, days, hours, seconds, and minutes to the date and time provided. You can subtract from a date and time by passing negative numbers to this function.

So here you see AddToDateTime. And then you see the date/time. That's the field you want to add to. Then you see the parameters that it's expecting, which would be the years, the month, the days, the hours, the minutes, and the seconds.

The string and value functions convert fields and variables to character strings and numbers. So I can say string value. That would convert the numeric to a string. I get a value on a string to convert a string to a number.

Here it talks a little bit about the AddToDateTime and AddToDate functions. So if I look over here and I see this AddToDateTime, and you see PSU_Task_Tbl.Start_Dt, and then you see 1, 3, 16, 0, 0, 0, what could it all mean? Well, that's saying that we want to go out here and add to the date/time. We're saying let's add one year, three months, 16 days, zero hours, zero minutes, and zero seconds.

You see AddToDate function if you're only concerned with the year, months, and days to calculate the date six months prior to today's date. So I've set up a variable here, &6MonthsAgo equals AddToDate %Date. So that would be today's date.

And then it would say 0, minus 6, and then 0. So the year, then the month, and then the day. So this be us going out here six months prior.

If I wanted to go 30 days prior, I could say something like &30Days equals AddToDate %Date. And I could say comma 0 comma 0 comma minus 30. And that would be 30 days prior.

Here's an example of using the-- examples of using string in value functions to convert information. So here you see we got a local string, &Task and &STR, local number &Nbr. And we're saying, &Task equals right trim string, and then the string value is 1234567890 period, plus sign, space. And then we're saying if none &Task, then number equals value string. So what could it all mean?

Well, if the string was only digits, then the tests would have no value. So when we came in here, if this was only digits out there, that would mean it would go out here and it would have no value. None would be inside the task. And it would set the number to be a value of the string, converting that string to be-- converting that information. So I'd say take that string and make it a number.

But if the string was equal to, let's say, 576, then converts the number 576. But if the string was 576A, do not convert to the number because it found something that was not a digit. So this is how, again, if I go out here and I'm like, OK, if these are only digits, let's go out here and when it is the right trim, it's going to come back with no value at all. And then we'll say take that string field and convert it to make it a number field, a value.

Reserved words. When a program references a PeopleCode-- PeopleSoft Application Designer definition name, PeopleCode uses reserve words to identify the type of definition being referenced. For example, Record.Record_Name, Page.Page_Name, Component.Component_Name, Scroll.Primary_Record_Name, so what's the name of the primary record of the scroll?

There's going to be a time that we're going to want to refer to a scroll. We could have multiple scrolls out on the page. So we could have multiple level one scrolls. A student application's an example where we have a scroll for a skill and a different one for education. So they're telling you to use the primary record to identify which scroll that you're wanting to work with.

If you prefix the ampersand to variables to identify them, you record Record_Name. to a field name to identify the specific or fully qualified field name. To identify records, pages, and so on in PeopleCode, you must prepend to other identifiers, so that is reserved words, so that PeopleCode will know what type of definition is being referenced. So the reserve word "Record" is used to qualify the record name and identify to PeopleCode the definition type.

Important, refer to PeopleCode Reserve Word Section in the online help to see a list of all the reserved words in PeopleCode. So these are some of the reserved words and their counterpart system variables. So reserved word "Record," and example would be Record.PSU_Task_Tbl.

Reserved word page, Page.PSU_Task. We could say %Page. %Page would refer to the current context, the page you're currently on. Notice component, Component.PSU_Task. Or we could say %Component, which would refer to whatever the component that we're on.

Scroll would be Scroll.PSU_Task_Tbl, where that's the name of the primary record of the scroll. There's no system variable for it. And menu name, MenuName.PSU_Training. You could also say %Menu to get the menu that you are currently on.

So choosing between page-specific and component-specific processing. When PeopleCode is attached to fields on record definitions, the same record definition may be used in more than one page or component. Therefore, any PeopleCode on a record definition may be performed in all the pages of the components where it's being used. If the program should only be performed in certain pages or components, conditional logic would need to be used.

The reserved word "Page" is used to qualify the page name and identify the definition type. The reserved word "Component" is used to qualify the component name and identify the definition type. So if a definition is renamed using the Application Designer, PeopleCode programs will automatically be updated if the reserved word is used.

If the reserved word is not used, and the definition name is given using a quoted literal-- bad, bad, bad, bad, bad-- then the definition will not be renamed in the PeopleCode program. So use component instead of page because it's more flexible. You might move fields or a scroll level to another page in a component at a later time.

The rename feature in Application Designer where renaming a definition changes all references to it, makes the use of the reserved word preferable to the use of literals. So for example, if %Component equals Component.PSU_Task_Resources, that one right there, if the Component.PSU_Task_Resources got renamed, it would automatically be updated in the PeopleCode. But if I said if %Component equals "PSU_Task_Resources" in quotes, then that means if I renamed the component PSU_Task_Resources, the component would not get updated in the PeopleCode.

Activity 14-- using PeopleCode built-in functions. In this activity, review the activity overview and use built-in functions to issue warnings for specific conditions on the Task page. Once you have completed activity 14, that will complete this lesson.

So in review, in this lesson, you learned that Oracle delivers many different types of built-in PeopleCode functions. You should use the MsgGet function to retrieve text stored in the message catalog for use with error and warning statements. Check for values in fields using in the All, None, or AllOrNone, or OnlyOne, or OnlyOneOrNone functions.

You can use string functions such as substring, right trim, left trim, find, and length to manipulate text strings. Use the AddToDate and AddToDateTime functions to perform date calculations. Use the string and value functions for data type conversions. And PeopleCode uses reserved words such as Record, Page, Component, and others to identify the type of PeopleSoft Application Designer definition that is being referenced. That concludes lesson 7, Using PeopleCode Built-in functions.
