Lesson 4, 

Understanding the Component Processor and PeopleCode Events. So our objectives, by the end of this lesson, you'll be able to trace the component processor flow, identify PeopleCode events, describe search events, describe component build and page display events, describe field action events, describe row action events, describe save action events, describe add mode processing, explain other processing flows, and describe deferred processing.

Tracing the component processor flow, the when, the where, and what, before you write a PeopleCode program, you need to decide three things-- when you want the program to run, determine which event or events in the component process or flow are most appropriate for your program. So when we talk about events, we're talking about field edit, field change, row and net, save pre-change, pre-built, post-built, those are different events. And we have to understand, when do those events get fired? When do they get executed, so the order of them and what's in the component buffer when they execute?

Where to place your PeopleCode, determine on which definition and perhaps on which field to place it. So do we want to put this at the component level? So we can put it on the component itself. Or we can do component record. Or we can do component record field. Or we could do page. Or we could do record field.

So the first thing that we really need to do is determine the location. So where do we need to place this code? In class most of the time, we will be placing it on the component. That way it doesn't affect as many different things. It only affects the component that we're placing it on.

And then, what to program, to determine the program logic meaning the syntax? Are we wanting to do a when message? Are we wanting to do an if/then else statement? What is it that we're trying to achieve?

So when we're looking at tracing the component processor flow, this is slide 51 in your guide. The first thing you see is we determine that component and then we do the reset state. When we're looking at this, when we talk about determine the component, a user selects a content reference. A content reference points us to a component.

The component buffers are flushed, or that's what the reset state means. When we say flush, we've cleared out the component buffers. There's nothing in them at this point.

A component has a property called a search record. A search record is used to build a search page based upon the record build properties of search key, alternate search key, and list box. And in this slide, we're discussing classic applications, not necessarily fluid here.

But it goes out there, the components search record is used to build the search page. The search page is built based upon the record field attributes of the search record-- search key alternate, search key and list box. Search keys and alternate search keys are filter fields on the search page. List box is going to be the result columns.

A user presses search and then selects a row from the list. The search key is used to build the SQL Select statements. The data for the entire component is loaded, including all of its pages. The component processor loops through each row selected from the database, loading it into the component buffer.

So when we do a search, and we get our values when the user selects a row from the grid, it uses the search key to load the high level key at level 0 for the component. And that is used to be below the component buffer.

So when we're looking at this, going to the next slide in our guide, slide 52, we'll talk about the rest of that now, if we're looking at the component build process, you see as we go through here, this is the building of the buffer, applying the defaults in displaying the page.

So as we're looking at this here, you see we've went through here, search page. Are we in add mode? No. If we're not in add mode, let's go out there and do the SQL Select based upon that high level key that the user selected.

And then it says, are there more rows to read? If yes, then we're going to go out of here and does a select row. And then adds the row to the buffer. Now, in your book, you'll see things like discard row, stop fetching. These are going to be other things that we'll talk about a little bit later as we go through the buffer when we start talking about our logic inside here that we can apply.

But as we go through here loading our data here, this is what we discussed a little bit when we were going through the debugger is we're saying, are there more rows to read? Well, it goes through and loads all the data in the component buffer.

So in the case of an application that we will be working with in the course, the PSU_TASK_TBL. Here's an example of loading information at level 0 pulling from the PSU_TASK_TBL. This is actually the component, the task resources and efforts.

But it goes out there and it says, all right, at level 0, we're pulling from the PSU task table. At level 0, it says we have to get the row. At level 0, you always have just one row of data at level 0. There cannot be a grid or a scroll area.

When we get a row, rows are made up of rows sets or records. So here you can see the record that we're referring to for the primary record at level 0 is the PSU task table. Records are made up of fields. And then it says, let's get the fields for that record.

So the fields that are listed at level 0 is our task ID and our description. So here you see getting the first task, task 1 and description PeopleTools 1. Then we said that rows are made up of records and row sets. Do we have a level one on this page of the component? Or does this component have a level 1, I should say.

The component buffer is loaded from left to right, top to bottom, so the first page, the next page, but we're looking for, do we have a level one? Here we say, yes, we've got a level 1. And the level 1 is referring to the row set PSU task resource.

And from the PSU task resource, we have rows of data. So row sets are made up of rows. And it goes in, retrieves the first row of data that is occurring at level 1.

Now in our application, if you chose task one, you would actually have four rows of data. But it gets the first row of data. We said rows are made up of row sets and records. It says records that we have at the level 1.

So it goes out, it says, OK, the record is PSU_TASK_RSRC. Records are made up of fields. It says, what are the fields? Well, this one has the fields at level one. We have instructor, EWK, resource name, Ed kellenberger, percent available, 50, completed flag is no. And what other fields might be occurring from that record would be loaded.

Since it's occurring at level 1, remember, we do full row allocation, meaning every column that's in that record regardless if it's on the page or not is going to get loaded into memory. Then after we've loaded that information-- so here you see for example telephone-- then it says, all right, rows are made up of records and row sets. Do we have a level 2 row set on our component? Yes we do. So it goes and says, gets the next level, level 2. Row set PSU_TASK_EFFORT.

Again, row sets are made up of rows. So here it says, all right, let's go get the first row for the level 2. Now as you can see here, we have four rows altogether.

So it says, all right, the first row of data, it says, rows are made up of records. It says get the record PSU_TASK_EFFORT. And then we have records are made up of fields.

And it says, load all the fields that are in that record PSU_TASK_EFFORT into the component buffer. So you see the effort date, 11/06/01, amount 7, charge back n. Once we have that, then it goes and continues on through the processing.

It says we're going to go out here. We've gotten the first row of data. But are there more rows that are occurring at level 2? So it says, all right, let's go out here and get the next row of data that's at level 2.

So we have another effort amount of November the 15th of 01, charge amount 8, charge back n. And then it says, do we have any more rows? Yes, we've got a row 3. Go load that into the buffer. Do we have any more? Yes, we have another row, row 4. We load that into the buffer.

Now, we didn't have to go to row level 3 because the page didn't have a level 3, or the component doesn't have a level 3. So that's why it gives all the rows that are occurring at level 2. Once it's done that, then it goes back, and it says, hey, go back to level 1.

Do we have any more rows at level 1 that are subordinate to the level zero key? The answer is yes. So it says, go get the second row from the record PSU_TASK_RSRC with the fields and instructor resource name, percent available, completed flag and telephone. So this time we're getting Jim Guss.

Once we grab that information and load it into the buffer, it says, hey, do we have a level 2? Yes, we do. Go get the level 2. So it pulls from the row set, PSU_TASK_EFFORT. Row sets are made up of rows. It gets the first row.

We have three rows for this higher level key for our instructor resource, JG, Jim Guss. It pulls from the record PSU_TASK_EFFORT. It gets the fields again, effort date, effort amount and charge back. This time it was January the 8th, 02.

After it grabs this information it says, hey, do we have a level 3? Nope, don't have a level 3. So let's get the next row of data for level 2. So going through the process again, it gets the next row of data that's for our level 2. And it's going to get the next row, which was January 7th of 02. Then it gets the next row which would be January 5th of 02.

It goes back and says, do we have another row of data that's at level 1? Yes, we do. We have the resource, Joe Yang. And let's go get again, that record and fields. And then once we get the records and fields from the task resource, it says, let's go to get the row set that's occurring at level 2 for this level 3 row.

So it goes back to level 2's RowSet PSU_TASK_EFFORT. It gets the first row of data. There's 3 rows for this one. Using the record PSU_TASK_EFFORT, it gets the fields. And again, we'll go through here and bring back the other two rows of data to get all three rows of data for the level 2.

It goes back to our level 1, it says, hey, do we have another row of data at level 1? Yes we do. So let's go get the next row out there for the record task resource for the resource Scott Sanchez.

It says, all right, does it have any child data at level 2? Yes it does. It goes to the level 2 row set task effort and gets the first row of data that is subordinate to resource Scott Sanchez for task 1 and gets the record task effort in the field. And it continues loading the buffer in this fashion.

Tracing the component processor flow here, so now if we look at this, we see, once we've got all the rows of data into the buffer, so we've added all the rows of data into the buffer, the next thing that's going to occur is it's going to apply record defaults. In your guide, this would be marked in color as step C.

Applying your record defaults, when it comes to our record defaults, that's going to be for all the default values that are set up on the record field for the pages that are in the component. And it displays the page and waits for a user action.

So talking about the process, it says tracing the process flow. Now all rows have been processed into the component buffer. Before displaying the page, the system applies default values to fields that have no values read from the database.

The default value set up in the record field definition is applied. If the record field does not have a default value, then it applies to system defaults. Blank if it's a character field. Zero if it's a number field.

And a page with data is displayed. And the component waits for the user's action. So at this point again, all the data is loaded into the buffer. Then we start to populate the page. When we're populating the page, it goes through there and loads the record defaults as we mentioned, looking at the record field properties to save as a default value.

If it does, it loads it. If it doesn't, then it's going to apply any system defaults. And again, character fields are blank. Number fields are zero. All others are null.

Tracing the component processor flow even further, now we've moved data over here to slide 53. It's loaded the page. It's waiting for the user's actions. So field changed by user.

So now the user is going to make a change occurring out there on the system. So field's going to be changed by the user. This is when it goes to make a change to the field, you see it's going to apply any standard system edit.

So if a user goes in and changes the value in the field, when they leave the field, it says, all right, does it pass our system edits? So the field was tied to a prompt table edit, or a translate table or a yes/no edit. It goes through those validation edits to make sure that it passes the information out here.

And if it doesn't pass, if we have an error, then it's going to display the error and display the page and wait for the user's action. If it passes the system edits, then it goes out here and accepts the change and goes back through applying any default record values and displays the page and waits for the user to do something.

So the next thing that we look at is talking about in row action. So row action that we have is we could go out and do a row action of insert process. When I do an insert, the component processor rebuilds the page for display applying record defaults. So when we talk about, if a user hits the plus sign, they want to go out here, and they want to insert a new row of data, so applies our record defaults for that new row and waits for the user to go out there and enter the data.

So here you see we have the row inserts. And we also have row delete. So with row insert, as you can see, it says, when the user hits the insert, it adds the row, applies record defaults, displays the page, waits for a users action.

When a user enters data into each one of those fields, it's going to go through there and apply the system edits. Like again, prompt tables, translate, yes/no edits, except the change.

The other option the user might do is if they're looking at a greater scroll, they might do a delete. So if they hit the Delete option, what's going to happen? So it says, with a row delete, it says, cancel or error option. It says, can they go out here and delete this one? If they get an error, reject a deletion, apply record defaults and display the page, wait for the users action.

If they're allowed to delete this row of data, then it's going to provisionally delete the row. Provisionally delete means it doesn't delete the row yet. It's going to say that it's going to be flagged for deletion when a user goes out there and saves the information.

So the row is actually just being marked for deletion. It's going to be left inside the buffer. It's moved to the end of the row set. The actual deletion is not submitted or finalized until the SQL Delete and Commit statements are issued on the database server as the final step of a safe process.

So once a row is marked for deletion, it's going to get ignored by other processing interactions on the row set, such as doing sorting or getting the active row count. So here just showing us when a user goes out of here and is the deletion, what's happening out here, the row is marked for deletion. It's left in the buffer and moved to the end of the row set. Row mark for dilation is ignored by their processing. And the SQL Delete and Commit statements occur on the Save action.

Slide 55 goes and says, what happens when a user hits saves? So going through the flow of the processor, you work through the flow again. But as you're looking through this one right here, you see what's happening when the user hits saves. It provisionally updates tables, SQL insert, update, delete. And then it does the SQL Commit of the data. And once that's occurred, then it's going to re-display the page and wait for another users action.
