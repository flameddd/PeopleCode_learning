Activity overview-- in this activity, you will replace WinMessage in a SaveEdit event. Activity detailed steps-- perform the detailed steps to complete the activity, placing WinMessage in a SaveEdit event.

To place a WinMessage in a SaveEdit event in PeopleSoft Application Designer, open the PeopleCode Editor for the PSU instructor component definition if it's no longer open. Select the Structure tab. Right-click on the PSU instructor component and select View PeopleCode.

From the left dropdown list, select the PSU instructor table record. Select the SaveEdit event on the right-hand list. Enter the following code for the SaveEdit. We're going to use the same code as we've been using, except for we'll change the literal to say SaveEdit.

We'll click the Save button, and let's go ahead and do that. I'll come back over here. Hit my dropdown. Here you'll see the SaveEdit. I'll paste in my code here. I'll change on the literal text t o that this will be the SaveEdit. And I'll save.

In the browser, select Instructors, Professional Details. Note, you'll receive a Save Warning message for changes you made in the previous activity. Click Cancel to continue without saving your changes.

Select Correct History box. Select the instructor JGY for Joe Yang and make a change to the page. Give Joe a middle initial. Click the Save button and observe the displayed messages to determine which events run.

So if I come back over to my PIA-- I've already exited the page, so I'll go to my nav bar, Recent Places. Go back into Professional Details. I'll hit OK on my SearchENet. I'll say instructor will be my JGY. I'll say Correct History. I'll do a search. You'll see the search save. I'll hit OK.

And now I get my pre-built executes, my row init executes for each row that's in the buffers here-- so the three rows. Once I come in here, I'm going to go and give Joe a middle initial. I'll say, initial g. And I'll hit my Save, and SaveEdit fires. Notice, now, the counter is five. I hit OK.

You see six, and I must hit OK twice. And then you see seven because it gets fired. The SaveEdit gets executed on all rows of data in my buffer. So it went through all of them. It only saved the data that's been changed though.

When the component is saved, SaveEdit fires once for each level one row. The following modal dialog box is being displayed as it counts through the rows. This concludes the activity. Please do not continue.
