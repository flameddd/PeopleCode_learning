In this activity, you will observe how this SetSearchDialogBehavior function is used to bypass the standard component search page.

Activity detailed steps. Perform the detailed steps to complete the activity using the SearchInit event to control the search page. To use the SearchInit event to control the search page, in the browser, from Navigator, select My System Profile to access the General Profile Informations page. Notice that you're taken directly to the General Profile Information page of the login user ID.

So if we come over here to our PIA, and if I come over to our Navigator, if I click on the Nav bar, go to the Navigator. And from the root level of the Navigator, I'll scroll down and click on My System Profile. And notice I went directly into the page the General Profile Information for the Student PeopleCode Student.

Notice that you're taken directly to the General Profile Information page at the logged in user ID. Sign into the Application Designer in two tier mode. And open up the PSUSERSELF_SRCH record definition.

So if we go back over here to our Application Designer, sign back in as our PT Code. Do a File Open. And we'll say Record. But in our record, we're looking for the PSUSERSELF_SRCH. And I'll open it up.

Right-click the OPRID field and select View PeopleCode to access the SearchInit program. Comment the line SetSearchDialogBehavior(0) as follows. So we're going to comment that went out with a REM statement.

So if we come over here to our OPRID, right-click and view PeopleCode, here we're in the SearchInit PeopleCode. And if we come over here and with the SetSearchDialog, I'm going to type in rem space. So that set a comment to comment this out SetSearchDialogBehavior(0) would say do not give me a search page. It says I want to suppress the search page. So we're commenting it out, saying, well, that's no longer going to be true for us. I'll save the program.

In the universal navigation header, click the Home icon. Then from Recent Places, select My System Profile to access the General Profile Information page again. Notice you're taken to a search page. And the user ID is populated with PT Code.

Come back in here and hit my F5. Or I could have came over to the Nav bar, went to my Recent Places in my System Profile. Either way, we get a search page. And notice it defaults in the user ID PT Code. And I do get a search page now.

Results-- compare the General Profile Information with the following results. This concludes the activity. Please do not continue.
