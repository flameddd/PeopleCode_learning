Activity 15. Writing user-defined functions. In this activity, you'l review the activity overview and write user-defined functions to modularize five programs that you wrote in earlier activities.

Activity overview. In this activity, you will convert five programs to call user-defined functions that are stored in function libraries. When creating and using functions, create a derived work record definition to as a function library. Create the FUNCLIB train record for this activity. By convention, user-defined function code is stored on the FieldFormula event.

In the PeopleCode programs that call your user-defined functions, declare the functions first. Then invoke the function, providing the parameters as required by the function definition. Try to use a different methodology for defining each function, for example by try using returns calls on one function definition, no parameters maybe for another, or maybe a different combination of using parameters and maybe a return clause for your input/output parameters and so on.

On the task page to calculate the effort to go for a task, the same PeopleCode program was used in three different PeopleCode events. Instead of using the same program in different places, create an external PeopleCode function to perform this logic.

This function can then be called wherever the logic is needed. On the Task Resources page, calculating the resource status based upon the percent available also reused a different PeopleCode into events, creating an external PeopleCode function to perform this logic.

Then we'll test your programs in the browser. You're go into to Setup Training, Training Tasks, Task Table to test the effort to go calculation. Then you'll select Training Task, Tasks Resources and Efforts to test the resource status values.

Activity detailed steps. Perform the detailed steps to complete the activity. Calculating the effort to go. On the Task page, in order to calculate the effort to go for a task, the same logic was used in several different PeopleCode programs. Instead of using the same program in different places, create an external PeopleCode function to perform this logic. The function can then be called whenever the logic is needed.

To calculate the effort to go in a function, create a new derived work record name FUNCLIB_TRAIN and add the effort to go to the record and save the definition. And go to my Application Designer. If we say File, New Record, and I'll bring over my field. And I'll choose to bring in the effort to go. I'll go to my record tab, make this a derived work record. And I'll hit Save. And we'll name this one FUNCLIB_TRAIN.

Create your user-defined function definition in the field formula event. So I come back over here and open up my record, my FUNCLIB_TRAIN. And go to effort to go and say view my PeopleCode. Here I'm on the field formula. So the first thing I'll do is I'll define it. So I'll say function. And we'll call this one calc_effort_togo.

And we'll tell it the parameters. I'll use parameters for this one. I'll say we're going to expect the parameter for a total, &total, comma, and then an &spent, comma, and then %effortremain. And of course, you could name these whatever you want to name them.

Once I've put in my function up here at the top, then I can come in here and set up what I want it to do. So I'll come in here and I'll say &effortremain is going to be equal to &total minus &spent. Then I'll say End-Function. I'll validate. Once I have it validated, I'll save it. And now we can go out here and use this function.

It says come out the existing code in the following three locations and add your PeopleCode program in the same three locations. So we want to do it on the task component task table RowInit and also on the task tables effort spent and effort total field change events.

So if we come back over here and open up my component. And if I go to my structure, and if I go to my task table and go into my PeopleCode for it, here's my RowInit that I currently have. I'm going to comment this one out. And we'll add our new code.

So I'm going to come in here and say to be able to use our formula that we created, we have to declare it. So I'll say declare function calc underscore effort underscore to go. And this is going to be a PeopleCode. We're going to look over in the record definition called func lib underscore train. And we'll be looking on the field called effort underscore to go. And this will be on a field formula.

And then I can come in here and tell it whatever it is that I want this to do. So I can come in here and say, let's do a-- call the function we just created the calc underscore effort underscore to go.

And we'll tell it what parameters we want to pass it. So I'm going to go to my records. And if I open up my task table. I'm going to bring in my effort total is my first parameter. Then I'll do a comma. I'll say bring in my effort spent. It's my second parameter. Comma. And then I'll bring in my derive train effort to go.

Close my parentheses. Punctuate it. And see what kind of typo I did. So func lib train effort to go not defined. So I look up here. I probably got a typo here. Yep, "to to." How about "to go?" Try that again. Ah, gotta love it when a plan comes together.

And what I'll do is I'll just cheat a little bit and copy this. Actually, I'll cheat a whole lot and copy the whole thing, even the ram. And I'll copy this, and now I'll go in here and choose to go to my effort spent. Field change. And I'll say we'll just delete this one. With the call to my function. And also go to my effort total and I'll say let's delete this one, and I'll put in the call to my function. And I'll save it.

Test your new programs from recent places. Select the task table in the browser. Alternatively, set up-- select the setup training, training task, task table. And evaluate the initial calculations of effort to go. Change the values of total effort and effort spent and evaluate the recalculation.

So we come over here and to our PIA. And I go to my nav bar. And go to my recent places, my task table. If I do a search and select one. We'll make sure when it came in it has the right effort to go. So that looks correct to me. If I make a change to one of these fields, like the effort spent, if I make this one 200, yep, recalculates effort to go. If I make this one maybe 600, yep, recalculates. Looking good.

What happens if I said 1,200 over here? And notice it recalculates, and I can see that I went 600 over. Got my negative sign. I'm not going to save any of it. If I come back over here to our guide-- so this is the results out here. So similar to what we had before. But now we're using a function.

Calculating the resource status. So when it comes to calculating the resource status that we have here. Similarly, on the task resource page, calculating the resource status based upon the percent availability used a PeopleCode program in two places. Create an external PeopleCode function to perform this logic.

So we're going to add the resource status field to the func lib train record definition. Let's go over here and do that. I'll save everything I've done so far. And I'll go back to my func lib train and come over here to my fields and bring in my resource status and drag it in. And hit my save on it. Save the definition.

Set up by your field formula logic that needs to be executed. So I come over here and go to my resource status and view my PeopleCode comes in on field formula. And this one right here before I do it, I think I'll try to get myself ahead maybe by going back over here to where we had it calculated before. So I'm going to come in here and go to my tasks resources. And go to my structure. And if I come back in here and go into my PeopleCode.

So this is our logic we did before. I'm just going to copy a little bit of this where I'm not re typing everything. And if I go back to my func lib train resource status build formula, now I'm going to set it to do that same logic but set it up to be done inside as a function.

So the first thing I need to do is say this is function. And I'll say this will be called resource status. And I'll say in parentheses here we'll have ampersand pct, the percent being used inside here. And this time we'll do returns. I'll say returns string.

And then I can come in here and tell it what I want to do. I'm going come in here and say evaluate and-- actually, I'll say evaluate and I'll say ampersand pct.

And when a 0, I'm going to say return equals 0. When 100, I'll say return equals 4. When greater than or equal to 50, we'll set the return equal to 3. When greater than or-- greater than or equal to 25, we'll say return equals 2. When other, I'll set the return to be equal to 1.

And if I wanted to, I could remove the breaks that I have in here. Not going to be needed this in this case.

End my evaluate and then I'll end my function. And I'll hit my validate. Syntax error. Expecting expression right here, so-- oh, got-- I got-- if I'm returning string, I don't need these that equals inside here.

And I'll go ahead and validate it. Looking good in the neighborhood now. And I'll go ahead and hit my save. And I'll go ahead and close this. And now I can come in here and change it to use my function everywhere I had this other code.

So if I come over here and go to my percent available, my field change. Now I could come in here and say let's declare my function up here. I'll say declare, and I'll say function. And we'll say resource status PeopleCode. And we'll say call it from the func lib underscore train dot resource underscore status. Use the field formula. And then we can call it.

So I'll say my derive train resource status is going to be equal to and I'll say my resource status. And I'll pass in my percent available. Validate it. Looking good.

And I'll go ahead and copy this and place it on the different places we need to have this one being used. So here's my field change. But I should be doing this on my RowInit for when we first come in.

And I'll save it. And then it's time to go out here and do my-- go back to my guide. And test your new programs. So select the setup training, training task, task resources and efforts. Evaluate the initial value for the resource status. And change the percent availability and evaluate the change in resource.

So if we come over here to the PIA. And let's go and go back to our nav bar. I go to my recent places, my task resource and efforts. Do a search and select a task. Make sure when I come in the RowInit executed. It's at 50. So semi-available. If I change this to 100, then I'm fully available. If I change it to 30, part-time. If I change it to 20, occasional. And if I put a 0 here, I'm not available. So everything is looking good.

I'm not going to save it. Come back over here to our guide.

Similar to activity 12, the following example illustrates the status for a resource. This concludes the activity. Please do not continue.
