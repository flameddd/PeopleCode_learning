Activity 9-- Examining Deferred Processing. In this activity, you'll review the activity overview and look at the settings to control deferred processing for the component, the page, and the field.

Activity Overview. In this activity, you will look at the settings on component definitions, page definitions, and page field properties that control deferred processing.

Activity Detailed Steps. Perform the detailed steps to complete the activity.

Examining Deferred Processing. At the component level, the processing mode is set in the Component Properties dialog box on the Internet tab. By default, under Processing Mode, the Deferred option is selected, meaning that deferred processing is enabled.

To examine deferred processing, in PeopleSoft Application Designer, open the PSU_TASK_RESOURCES component. Select File, Definition Properties to open the Component Properties dialog, and then select the Internet tab. So we come back over here to our Application Designer. I'll close what we have opened currently. And I'll come over and open up our component, PSU_TASK_RESOURCES.

And if we go to our Properties, go to our Internet tab, and here's where we'll find our Processing Mode group box, over here on the right, in the middle of the section. It says, in the Processing Mode group box. To deselect deferred processing, select Interactive. To select deferred processing, select Deferred. Accept the default for this component to stay as Deferred.

You can also select Allow Expert Entry to enable the Expert Entry checkbox on the component, which allows an expert user to force the component to run in deferred mode, regardless of the component settings in the PeopleSoft Application Designer. Note, the Enable Expert Entry option must also be selected for the user ID. So in the browser, select PeopleTools, Security, User Profiles, User Profiles. Select PTCODE user ID. On the General page, notice the setting for the Enable Expert Entry option.

So if we take a look at this, if I come over here to my App Designer, here you see the Processing Mode. If I say Interactive, that means everything on the component will be interactive. If I select Deferred, that means it will defer to the page, to see whether it runs an interactive or deferred. We could have multiple pages in a component, so some could be running interactive, some could be deferred.

Here you'll see the option that says Allow Expert Entry. If this is selected, then it compares-- if I check this one right here, it says we don't care if this was an interactive application. It says if this is a-- if the user is also an expert entry, they can run it in Deferred Mode. They even have the option to turn off the Deferred in the application to be able to run it in Interactive.

If I hit my OK here and I go to my PIA, if I go to my Nav bar, go to my Navigator, if I go to my PeopleTools folder, go to Security, User Profiles, and User Profiles, if I inquire upon my user ID, PTCODE, inside here is where you see the checkbox. It says, Enable Expert Entry. So even if the component is set to allow Expert Entry, if this is not selected, this user still wouldn't see expert entry.

Notice setting of the Refresh option in the Toolbar group box. When Allow Expert Entry is selected, then the Refresh option will automatically be enabled too. When the Refresh checkbox is selected, a Refresh button appears in the component toolbar, enabling the user to force a trip to the server. Users can always press Alt-0 to force a server trip, even if the Refresh button is not displayed.

So if I come back over here and go back to my Properties, and we go back to our Internet tab, here's where you see the Refresh button. And if I come in here and turn on my Deferred, notice it automatically sets up to have a Refresh button. And if I hit OK, if I go over here to the PIA just to show an example of a application with a Refresh button, if I come in here and I go into my student's personal information, if I'm inside here, and let's say I go to Education and Skills. This one is running in Deferred. And if I put XXX, and I want to see that validate, I can click on the Refresh button, which says Force a trip to the server, invalidate.

Click the Cancel button off of the component. Open up the PSU_TASK_RESOURCES page. So if we come back over here-- and I'm not going to save this one-- I'll open up the PSU_TASK_RESOURCES page. Access the Page Properties in the Use tab, and notice the Allow Deferred Processing option is selected. Press the Cancel button.

So if I come back over here and go to my Properties, go to my Use tab, down here you see the checkbox, Allow Deferred Processing. It is selected. So the component allowed deferred processing. The page allows deferred processing. When both the component and page is saying allow deferred, then it's deferring the processing to page controls,

Click the Cancel button. From the PSU_TASK_RESOURCES tasked resources page, double-click the Instructor label to open up the Edit Box properties dialog box for the INSTRUCTOR field. So if I come in here and open up the INSTRUCTOR field, so select the Use tab. Notice that the Allow Deferred Processing checkbox is selected. Deselect the Allow Deferred Processing checkbox to make this field interactive, and then click the OK button.

If I come back over here and go to the Use tab, notice right now it is Allow Deferred Processing. If I deselect it and hit OK, that says this one field on the page is going to run interactive. Select the Order tab on the PSU_TASK_RESOURCES page. Scroll to the far right. Notice that the checkbox for Allow Deferred Processing are Display Only and cannot be changed here.

Also notice the checkbox for the INSTRUCTOR field is deselected. So when we're looking at the Order tab here-- and let me maximize this window-- here you'll see the INSTRUCTOR field. And notice, over here, it says, Allow Deferred Processing. It is not selected. Select Window, Close All. Do not save. This concludes the activity. Please do not continue.
