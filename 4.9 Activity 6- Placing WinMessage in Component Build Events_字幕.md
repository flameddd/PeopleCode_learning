Activity 6, Placing WinMessage in Component Build Events. In this activity, you will review the activity overview and place WinMessage in PreBuild and RowInit events so that you can see exactly when those events run in the component processor flow.

Activity Overview. In this activity, you will place WinMessage function calls in PreBuild and RowInit events. By placing a WinMessage in an event, you can see exactly when that event runs.

Activity Detailed Steps. Perform the detailed steps to complete the activity.

Placing WinMessage in PreBuild and RowInit Events. To place the WinMessage in PreBuild and RowInit in PeopleSoft Application Designer, open up the PeopleCode Editor for PSU Instructor component definition if it's no longer open. Select the Structure tab, right-click on the PSU Instructor component, and select View PeopleCode.

From the left dropdown list, select PSU Instructor Table record. From the right dropdown list, select RowInit. Enter the following codes on the RowInit. Component integer &C. &C = &C plus 1. WinMessage RowInit on Component dot PSU Instructor, comma, PSU Instructor Table-- all that's literal-- concatenated with the PSU Instructor Table dot Instructor field. Concatenate that with the literal text Counter =. Concatenate that with &C, and then ,0.

This time we're placing it in the style parameter. So if we come over here to our Application Designer-- and I already have my Student Component open and on record, so I really just need to come over here to my events and choose RowInit. And I'm going to cheat a little and paste in what I did earlier.

Change the SearchInit to say, you guessed it, RowInit. RowInit on component of my PSU Instructor Table information, bringing in the instructor information Counter = &C. And then again, I'm going to come over here before ending this and do a comma and pass in the style parameter of the 0 after this. And again, that right there, when you're bringing in the style class out here, is going to determine how the page gets built out here. So we're just going to put that one in here. And actually, I might copy this whole thing, because we might be doing this again in a few moments.

I go back to my guide. From the left dropdown, click the Instructor component. Right down, say PreBuild. And on the PreBuild, we're going to do exactly the same thing. The only thing I see different is changing what event we're on, because we're trying to let you see when the events get executed.

So we come back over here, and I'll validate this one has no errors. Then I'll come over and say let's go to my PreBuild information out here. So I need to come in here and choose my-- on the left-hand side, I need it come in here and choose my component. And then on the right-hand side, I'll choose PreBuild. I'll paste this in and change this from RowInit to say PreBuild. And everything else will be the same.

I'll hit my Save, and the browser will go into Instructors Professional Details. Select Correct History and choose Joe Yang, so we'll say JGY. And observe the order in which the messages appear and how they appear. So we come in here and click back on my Nav bar. Recent Places, if I go into my Professional Details. And here again, I see my SearchInit.

Now your SearchInit, notice it's equal to 1. I do an OK here. I'll [INAUDIBLE] Correct History, and I'll search for Instructor JGY, and I do a search. Then you see my Search Save gets executed. And so this one says 2.

Now that your Search page has different buffers than the component. So once we've executed our Search Save and it takes me into the row of data, now we'll be working with the Component buffers, which is separate than the Search buffers. So when I hit OK, notice it says PreBuild on Component got executed.

So notice it's a 1. It's not a 3, because now [INAUDIBLE] this is a separate buffer that we have out here, Component buffer. So initially we got it set to 1. I hit OK. After the PreBuild executes, you see the RowInit executes. And notice it's a 2 now, so I added 1 to it. I hit OK.

And notice you see it's a 3, RowInit. Notice up here it says there's three rows out here. So if I hit OK again, you see now it's equal to a 4. And I hit OK, and now it's completed.

When the component is built, PreBuild fires, the following modal dialog box gets displayed saying [INAUDIBLE] a PreBuild is equal to 1. In addition, RowInit fires once for each row in the level 1 scroll. When RowInit fires the final time, the following modal dialog box will be displayed, and that would be just showing you the first time. So that's not the last time. It says 2, but it'd be how ever many rows was inside there.

This concludes the activity. Please do not continue.
