Activity 13-- Reviewing the Setup for Contextual Prompt Table Edits. In this activity, you will review the activity overview, and then review the steps that were taken to set up a contextual prompt table edit.

Activity Overview. In this activity, you will review the activity overview, and then review the steps that were taken to set up a contextual prompt table edit, specifically, how the contextual prompt table edit was implemented for the Review Details page.

Activity Detailed Steps. In this activity, you will review the business rules; review and identify an appropriate field in the DERIVED work record definition; review the EDITTABLE field that was added to the page definition; review that the field is invisible and display-only. Steps 3 and 4 are combined in this activity.

Review that the prompt table edit value is %FieldName; review whether the triggering field needs to be interactive; and review the PeopleCode program that contextually sets the prompt table.

So Reviewing the Business Rules-- the business rules for this application dictate that if the reviewer type is an employee self-assessment, then the Reviewer ID should equal the Employee ID and be display-only. If the review type is Supervisor, then the Reviewer ID prompt value should be restricted to supervisors only. If the reviewer type is peer or performance, then the reviewer ID prompt are only open to an employee.

So if we take a look at this right here, if we come over here to our PIA, if I navigate to go to my Nav bar, go to my Navigator, and go into my-- back to my room level inside here on my menu. And if I go to my Employees folder, and I go into my Review Details. I do a Search, and let's say I select the Employee Cornelia.

If I take a look over here, first thing we want to know is that the review type here says Employee Self-Assessment. And if it's an employee self-assessment, it pulls from our level zero. It employs the employee ID to load into the Reviewer ID. So it puts it in here, into the Reviewer ID, and disables this field.

If I come over here and I change this to a Peer Review, now you'll notice that it enables the field and gives us a prompt here. And if I do a lookup on this prompt. we could see we get 144 rows of data. And this is all of Cornelia's peers in the company. If I Cancel, and I come back over here to my dropdown, and I change this to be a supervisor, per se.

And now if I go to the Reviewer ID, and I do a lookup, notice that instead of getting 144 rows, I now only see 32 rows. So I'm only seeing those employees who are supervisors. So the prompt table is going to be based upon the review type. You'll see that we have some field change and row init PeopleCode that determines what gets loaded based upon that review type.

Reviewing and Identifying an Appropriate Field in the DERIVED Work Record Definition. Open up the DERIVED record definition. The DERIVED record is a delivered record containing 133 fields. You will likely find one that meets your business requirements. You cannot clone the DERIVED record because its name must be DERIVED.

The EDITTABLE field, which is the first field in DERIVED, is probably appropriate for most purposes. If you need more than one contextual prompt table on a component, you can use EDITTABLE2, EDITTABLE3, and so on. So if we come back over here to our Application Designer, if I do a File, Open, and I say Record, and I say Open up DERIVED, here you'll notice in this DERIVED work record, you'll see the fields. And you'll see EDITTABLE, EDITTABLE2, EDITTABLE3. And again, these would be the fields that you could be utilizing to be able to have a prompt that is going to be contextual based.

Steps 3 and 4. For PeopleCode to access the value in the field, the field must be loaded in the component buffer, which means that it must be on the page. But in the same level is the prompt table field. In most instances, you will want to make the field display-only, and probably invisible, because the user doesn't need to see it. So if we open up the PSU_EMP_REVIEW page definition, on the page definition, we'll double-click the field labeled EDITTABLE, and we'll notice that it's DERIVED, and the field name is EDITTABLE.

On the Use tab, notice that both Display-Only and Invisible are selected. So if I come back over here and open up our page, our PSU_EMP_REVIEW. And if I'm looking at this page, notice over here, at the same location where we have the Reviewer details, the Review Type, to the right of it, you see the Edit Table.

And if I double-click on Edit Table, notice this is the DERIVED field called EDITTABLE. It has to be on the page in the same level. And if we take a look on the Use tab, you can see we've set it up as display-only, and it's been set up as Invisible.

Reviewing that the prompt table edit value is % and the field's name. So in the record field properties of the field that will have the contextual prompt, you set the prompt Table Edit to %FieldName, in which the field name is the selected field on the DERIVED work record. In this usage, percent represents the DERIVED record. If you use the EDITTABLE field, you would enter %EDDITABLE as the prompt table name in the record definition.

To review the prompt Table Edit field, Right-Click on REVIEWER_ID, select View Definition from the pop-up menu. Double-click on the REVIEWER_ID to access as record field properties. Now in the Edit tab, you'll see the %EDITTABLE. So if we come back over here, and let's say if I go over here to my Reviewer ID, and I Right-Click on it and say View Definition. And here's the Reviewer Id. If I double-click on it and go to the Edit tab, notice here it says it's a prompt table 2%EDITTABLE, so % and whatever field name that we're using inside the DERIVED work record.

Step 6, Reviewing Whether the Triggering Field Needs to be Interactive. If the prompt table is to be based on an EDITTABLE field, then you must enable interactive processing for that field. Otherwise, the incorrect prompt table review may be used when the user accesses the lookup or type ahead functionality. To review that the triggering field is in Interactive Mode, on the page definition, double-click on Review Type. Select the Use tab, and notice that the Allowed for Processing checkbox is cleared. This field must be in Interactive Mode for the Field Change PeopleCode to execute as soon as the field is changed.

So if we come back over here to our Application Designer, and I go to my Review Type field, if I double-click on it, go to the Use tab, notice down here, the Allow Deferred Processing is deselected.

Step 7, Reviewing the PeopleCode Program that Contextually Sets the Prompt Table. When writing the PeopleCode program to support the business rules, consider all the events in which your code needs to be placed, which include RowInit and FieldChange, and possibly Prebuild. Depending upon the complexity of your business rules, you could use an Evaluate or an If-Then-Else construct to set the value of the field for the DERIVED record.

To review the PeopleCode program that contextually sets the prompt table, open up the PSU_EMP_REVIEW component definition. And once I've opened up my PSU_EMP_REVIEW component definition, we'll go into the Structure tab, Right-Click, View the PeopleCode, and we'll select the REVIEW_TYPE.FieldChange.

Notice that the code that populates DERIVED EDITTABLE with appropriate values are based on the value of the Review Type. So if we come in here and go to our structure tab, and if I look at my PeopleCode out here for Review Type, and if I say show me that PeopleCode, here on my FieldChange event, we can see what's happening.

So we're setting the PSU_EMP_REVIEW Reviewer ID to its default value. The PSU_EMP_REVIEW Reviewer ID enabled to set to true. And then we get the Evaluate. Evaluate PSU_EMP_REVIEW Review Type. When it's an S, meaning Supervisor, set the DERIVED.EDITTABLE field to be equal to PSU_SUPERVISOR_VIEW and then break.

If it's equal to a F-- and notice it says and when it's equal to a P, so when either one of these are equal to F or P, we're going to set the DERIVED EDITTABLE field to be Personal Data. That's going to be the name of the record that we're going to prompt to and break. When it's equal to an E for self-reviews, set the DERIVED EDITTABLE field to None. And we're going to set a Reviewer ID value to the same as the User ID at level zero. And set the Enabled field to be false in the Evaluate. This concludes the activity. Please do not continue.
