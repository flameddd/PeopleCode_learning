"Activity Overview." In this activity, you will place a WinMessage in a RowInsert event. By placing WinMessage in an event, you can see exactly when that event runs.

"Activity Detailed Steps." Perform the detailed steps to complete the activity.

"Placing WinMessage in a Row Action Event." So to place a WinMessage in a Row Action event, in PeopleSoft Application Designer, open the PeopleCode editor for the PSU instructor component definition if it's no longer open. Select the Structure tab. Right-click on the PSU instructor component and select View PeopleCode.

From the left dropdown list, select PSU instructor table record, and from the right dropdown list we will choose the RowInsert and we'll enter in the following code. So on the RowInsert, we'll initialize or declare the component. &C is component. We'll increment the counter for it. WinMessage message will do a RowInsert on our component PSU instructor instructor table that literal text, concatenated with the instructor field, concatenated with the literal text Counter, concatenated with the actual value of the variable, and again set in a style to be a 0. And we'll save the page.

So if we come back over here to our Application Designer, and if I come in here, and I'll just copy all this. I think it's already out there, but I'll copy it again. And I'll hit my dropdown, and I'll choose to go back into my record. And on my record, this time I'll hit my dropdown, and I'll choose the RowInsert. Paste my code in here. I'll change the pre-build to say RowInsert, and I'll validate my information here.

When we talk about the processes inside here, what are the events when a row gets inserted in a scroll? So we talked about this a few moments ago. We said when a user goes to insert a new row of data in a scroll, it's going to execute the field default, then the field formula, then the RowInsert, and then the RowInit. It doesn't execute pre-built or post-built. Remember, those only get executed one time during that component processor flow.

So I'll save what I've done here. I'm going to come back over here. Hit Save in the browser. Go to Instructors Professional Details. Select the Correct History, and select instructor JGY. And we'll do that first.

So if I come back over here and hit F5 to go back to my Search page-- So here I got my searching it. And if I come in here, I'll say look for JGY again, and I'll turn on my Correct History and I'll do my search. Again, we see my search save getting fired. I hit OK.

You see pre-built gets executed. Then you see that the RowInit is being executed. Hit OK. You see it'll get executed for each one of those three rows. Now it's waiting for me to go out here and do something.

In the Instructor Information group box, and not in the Course Certifications grid at the bottom, click the Plus icon to insert a new row, and observe which events are going to get executed. So if we come back over here and I hit my plus sign up here from my scroll, you'll see that we have RowInsert got executed when I hit my plus sign. And I hit OK. And then you see RowInit gets executed, and you can see the counter being incremented.

The results of our actions when a row is inserted. RowInsert fires, and the following modal dialog box gets displayed. So you see RowInsert. Then you see a RowInit fires again following the RowInsert.

This concludes the activity. Please do not continue.
