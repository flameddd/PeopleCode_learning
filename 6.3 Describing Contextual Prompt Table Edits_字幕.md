contextual prompt table edits-- when to use contextual prompt table edits. When we talk about a contextual prompt table edit, it is a variable prompt. Your business rules often require that a particular field prompt from different records, depending upon contextual factors that are determined at runtime, such as which components the field is in, who the user is, and the value of another field in the component.

For example, business rules could dictate that if the review type is an employee self-assessment, then the reviewer ID should be equal to the employee ID and be display only. If the review type is supervisor, then the reviewer ID prompt value should be restricted to supervisors only.

If the review type is peer or performance, then the reviewer ID prompt values are open to any employee. If we take a look at this, if I go into my Application Designer, and let's go back into our PIA, if I go to my nav bar, go to my Navigator, and I'm going to go to employees.

And I'm going to go into the reviewer details. I'm going to do a search, and if I select Cornelia, if I select her, you see we've got a level 0, a level 1, a level 2 on this reviewer details page, and when I'm looking at level 01, notice my employee ID is employee ID 1. And you can see Cornelia Aguilera is my name for that high level key.

We have a level 1 data for the reviewer details. And then we have a level 2 reviewer details. If I'm looking over here in the reviewer details, notice right now, the review type. Review type right now says employee self-assessment. When it's employee self-assessment, notice the reviewer ID field down below here. It says it's going to be reviewer ID 1, which is the same as the employee ID, and it's display only.

So I cannot change this information. Let's say I changed this from employee self-assessment. If I come in here and I change this to be a peer review, let's watch what happens. When I change it to a peer review, then reviewer ID becomes input capable. Not only is it input capable, it has a lookup, it has a prompt. And if I click on the prompt, we can see that it looks up the reviewer ID. And notice the reviewer ID's results.

I got 144 employees that I can select to do my peer review. So 144 employees. If I cancel back from here, and let's say I go back to review type, if I click on this dropdown, and this time I'm going to change it to a supervisor. It still gives me an input capable reviewer ID, but notice when I click on the prompt, the lookup. I don't have 144 rows of employees showing up. Now I'm only seeing 32 rows of data.

And all the rows of data that I'm looking at are employees who are a job type of supervisor. So the prompt table is based upon the review type. There's some PeopleCode out here, field change, row, and need that determines what gets set up for this prompt table. If we take a look at this, if I cancel here, and let's say I open up this component. If I look up here, this is the PSU Emp Review component.

And take a look at the PeopleCode that we have on it. So if I do a File Open, Component, PSU Emp Review, and I open this one up. And if I go in here to my structure tab, I could go in here and take a look at the PeopleCode that we have on here.

So I'm going to look at the PSU Emp Review, and if I click over here, I'm going to look at the review type, and I'm going to say, show me the PeopleCode. And here you can see, we have some field change PeopleCode being invoked on here.

So if I look at this, the first thing you see when I'm looking at this code is this says, PSU Emp Review reviewer ID, set default. So what set default does, it sets it back to its default value. So anytime someone goes in and changes the review type, set the value back to the default, which if we don't have a default value set up at the record field level, and we don't have any PeopleCode set default values for the event, then if this is a character field, it's setting it back to a blank. If it's a number field, it'd set it to zero.

Says PSU Emp Review reviewer dot reviewer ID enabled is equal to true. So by default, we can go in and type into this field. But then you look-- it says evaluate PSU Emp Review reviewer type. And here it says, when it's an S, S meaning a supervisor, we're saying, set the derived editable equal to PSU super view.

So this is PeopleCode that's saying that if the review type is supervisor, we want to set this derived editable to be PSU supervisor view. Notice, if it's F or a P, we're going to set this derived editable to be equal to personal data. So what could it all mean? Well, let's go back before I look too much longer at this code. I'm going to come back over here and go to my component. And I'm going to open up this page, PSU Emp Review.

And if I take a look at this page in here, you'll notice we have a field in here called Edit Table. I want you to notice that. But before I go into it, I want you to notice, we've got the reviewer ID has a prompt on it. So you see the icon. If I right click on this field on the page and say, show me the definition, this will open up the record definition.

And here's my reviewer ID field. I'm going to double click on the reviewer ID field. And if I go to the Edit tab, you'll notice that this one says, you're going to have a prompt table edit, 2% editable. So the lookup on the page is saying, for our prompt, it wants you to go to a table kind of percent editable. What does it all mean?

Well, percent editable is a system variable. So this is a system variable. This is going to be found on a derived work record, and it's placed on the page. So here, you see percent editable. So you can see, it's looking up the percent editable. If I close this record, and I look on the page, here you see this field called Edit Table. And if I double click on this, this is the field called editable, and it's pulling from a derived work record called derived.

Now, this field, whatever that prompt table's pointing to, it has to be on the page. It has to be loaded into the component buffer. But what you notice here is, it's coming from a derived work record called derived. It's a field called editable. And if I go to my Use tab, notice it's display only, but even more important, it's invisible. So the user doesn't ever see this field. But it's out here on the component buffer.

And if I come in here, and I want to look at this, if I say, show me the money, open up the record definition-- lookie here! We have all these fields out here, editable, editable 2, editable 3, editable 4. These are all system variables that we can use on this work record.

Anytime you want a variable prompt, you can put the field onto the page from derived work record in one of these fields. Why do we have so many? Well, what if I need to have a page that maybe has five different variable prompts on it? Each one would add their own editable field that they would point to. So that's what that's all about. The percent editable says, it's a system variable that's going to say, let's go out here and I have this memory location that's going to store the location that we're going to prompt to.

Now if I come back over here and look at my code again, so now you see we're saying, set that field derived editable to be equal to PSU supervisor view when we're looking at a review type of S for supervisor. We see here, if it's F or P, let's set this to be personal data out here.

When it's E, let's go make this derived editable field set to none, meaning nothing out here, and we're going to set the value for the reviewer ID to be equal to the employee ID. And we're going to set it to be enabled false, meaning set this field to be display only.

If I come over here and take a look, we also should have row and knit PeopleCode out here. If I come in here and go to my record, when we're coming in in inquiry mode, again, notice the same type thing or similar is being done out here, saying, if it's a supervisor, is the current value set to look up field to use the PSU supervisor view?

If it's equal to F or P, set the lookup field for the reviewer ID to be using personal data to able to look up page. Or set it to none, if it's an employee self review. And this is showing you that code that we just looked at.

How to set up contextual prompt table edits-- follow these steps to set up a contextual prompt table edit. Define your business rules. Review and identify an appropriate field in the derived work record definition. Add the field from the derived work record into the page where that requires a contextual prompt edit. Make the field invisible, and set it to display only.

Set the prompt table to edit its value to the percent field name that you used in the derived work record. Set the triggering field to interactive, and that's optional, but typically, you'd want them to be able to do it immediately. And then write the PeopleCode programs needed to support the business rules by contextually prompting against different records.

And one thing to note down here in your student notes, it says the derived work record definition is delivered specifically for the purpose of creating contextual prompt table edits. You cannot, I repeat, you cannot create your own derived work record definition for this purpose.

However, you can use any of the fields in this record, or add fields to derived, but the record has to be derived. When you specify a field in derived that will hold a prompt table name, use the percent to represent the derived and add the field name.

Syntactically, this is represented as percent field name. For example, if you use the derived editable field to hold the prompt table, the actual value would be entered as percent editable. And that's what we just looked at. So to give you a little bit more time to look at this, I want you to take a few moments and do activity 13.

Activity 13 will be reviewing the setup of contextual prompts, table edits. In this activity, you'll review the activity overview, and then review the steps that were taken to set up a contextual prompt table edit. Once you complete activity 13, that will complete this lesson.

So in review, in this lesson, you learned that you create variables by explicitly declaring them at the beginning of your PeopleCode programs. The scope of variables can be local, component, or global. The PeopleCode editor will auto-declare your variables with a scope of local and a type of any if they are not explicitly declared.

PeopleCode supplies a number of system variables, all of which begin with percent sign. You can use derived work fields instead of variables when a calculated value must appear on a page, but does not need to be stored in the database. Contextual prompt table edits can conditionally prompt against data from different record definitions. That concludes lesson 6, using PeopleCode variables.
