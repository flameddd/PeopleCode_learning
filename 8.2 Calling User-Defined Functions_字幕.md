Calling functions. To call a function, you use the function name. Within the parentheses, pass the correct number of parameters, zero or more. The number of parameters must always match the function definition. And the data type, as specified, must be compatible.

So we kind of looked at this code a few moments ago. So here you see, again, the purchase order header. Order number say pre change. They declare the function, assign order number PeopleCode on derived work record funclib education services on field ordernumber on event field formula. And then you see, if the purchase order header order number is new and the mode is A, then we're going to call that function assign order number. Passing the parameters, or parameter, PSU, purchase order header order number.

If we come in here and take a look at this in our training environment, I created an application a little bit earlier here that's going to be used to keep up with an employee's total salary, counting a bonus. So this is the one I created. So it's not actually in your training environment. But what I did is I went and created a couple fields here. I created a field called total salary, which is a number field, 10 with two decimals. I created another field here called Bonus, which is a number field, four integers, one decimal. And then I included them into a record out here called the pay table.

The pay table is keyed by employee ID. It has the field called salary, and a field called bonus. Then I created a derived work record that is called derive pay. And this one has my field out here called total salary.

Once I did that, I created a page. The page I called pay. And you can see, it has the employee ID, base salary, and bonus from the pay table. And then we have a related field to bring in the employee's name, and we have this bonus field coming from the derived work record called derived pay.

And then we put this all in a component that I have set up to run interactive. And I've already registered this. So now, talking about creating functions. How do I create functions out here?

Well, I'm going to say File, New. I'll say record. And I'll say let's bring in my field that I created called total salary. I'll go to record type and say this is a derived work record.

I hit Save. And I tell it the name. Remember, the prefix should start with funclib underscore something. So here I'll call mine, my app.

I hit OK. And now, I can go in here and set up my logic on the field formula. So if I say display my people code, if I come over here and click on the field formula, it opens it up. And here I can create my function.

I start it off with the reserve word function. And then I'm going to name this function CalcPay. And this function will not have any parameters. So I'll just put in an open, close parentheses.

Then I'll define what this is going to do. I'm going to say out here it's going to calculate the total salary. So I'm going to go over here to my record. And underneath my derived pay, I'm going to bring in the total salary field. And I'm going to come in here and say that this one right here is going to be equal to the pay table with the salary, plus the pay tables bonus. And then I'll end this with end function.

Probably not spelled the best I could do. But we get the idea. Right? Validate it. It corrects all that stuff. I'll save this function. And then if I want to use it, I'll open up my component, my pay component I created.

I'll go to my Structure tab. Go to my pay table. Right click, and say View PeopleCode. And now, I'll set up the logic that needs to be executed.

The first thing we said is you got to declare the function. So I'll say, declare, and I'll say function, CalcPay. And I'll say this is of type PeopleCode. You'll find this one on my funclib my app, on the field TOTAL_SAL. And the logic is going to be on the field called FieldFormula.

Then I'll tell it what I want it to do. So when this gets executed, I'm going to say, just do a CalcPay. And I'll say open, close parentheses, and semicolon.

I'll copy this information. I need to do this on the salary field, on field change. And I also need to do this on the bonus field for field change.

Save it. Unknown function. I must have misspelled something inside here. I hate it when that happens. So if I look at it, sure enough, I did. And then I copied it everywhere. Didn't I?

That's the problem with copy, paste. You make one mistake, you put it in every location. So I'll say, CalcPay. And let me go back and fix the typo on the other ones as well.

And I'll save it. And now, if I come back over here to my PIA, if I go to my NavBar, go to my Navigator, if I go in here to Employees, this is where I registered it if I open up my Employee Pay with Bonus.

If I do a search, and I'll bring up employee ID one, I'll say the base salary is $98,000. I'll say they got a bonus of $2,500. So their total salary with bonus is $100,500.

So this is using a function to be able to do this without having any parameters on it. We'll come back over here to our guide. Functions with parameters. Just as with built in functions, parameters can be passed to user defined functions. Parameters can be fields, variables, or literals. By convention, the input parameters are listed first, followed by output parameters.

Parameters are passed to a function by reference, which means the value of any parameter can be modified by the function. When we say it's passed by reference, that means when it gets into the function, you're actually changing the same memory field. So both from where it's calling, and the function itself.

The parameters in the function definition specified using the variable syntax are local to the function. Any local variables declared within a function are also local to that function.

Parameters can be type controlled by specifying the as keyword, followed by any conventional or object data type. So function, calc something, ampersand parameter 1 as number, ampersand parameter 2 as number.

Here, again, if we take a look at the sample code down here of the assigned order number, notice that when we go in here and call the function assign order number, it's using a parameter called ampersand order number.

Now, typically it's a good idea when you're working with these functions to use the function parameter as, and then tell it the type. That way the compiler can catch any type of mismatching types. They're not doing it here, but you could. And that's what we're looking at inside here.

So in my last one that we did, this is the code that I just did down here at the bottom. I created this CalcPay, and we set it up with no parameters. But there is a problem when you do it with no parameters. The problem is that I could use this function only when using these very three specific fields. So in my code over here, if I take a look at it, when I am using this, I can only use this function when I'm dealing with the specific fields out here that are derived pay, total salary, pay table salary, and pay table bonus. That's a pretty big thing to do. It makes it very inflexible. So not a good thing.

But if I use parameters-- over here it shows you an example of doing the same thing with parameters-- I could set it up to use parameters for salary, bonus, and total pay. And set it up as you see here. Then when I call it, I could call this from anywhere that it needs to be used, where it's going to add two fields together and sum it in another one. And it's not specific to certain fields in certain records. It could be used anywhere where I need to add the fields.

We come in here and take a look at that. If I come back over here to my environment here, if I wanted to change this one out here to use parameters, I'll come over here where it says function CalcPay. And I'll say, let's do ampersand Salary, comma ampersand Bonus, comma. And I'll say ampersand Total_Pay.

So I'll tell it-- and, again, I don't have to add the spaces in here. I don't want you to think you've got to type a space in between each one. But I can put in the parameters that I want it to pass. Then over here, instead of telling it the specific fields that's going to be used to do this calculation, I can use these parameters and say ampersand total underscore pay equals. And I could say ampersand salary plus ampersand bonus.

Validate my code here. Make sure I didn't have no typos. Save it. Now, if I come back over here to where I use it at, if I come in here, and here's an example of using it on field change. So now I need to change this inside here. I would come in here and do my CalcPay. And I would tell it what to pass in. There it is. PAY_TBL.

I can say come in here and let's pass in my salary. Again, the positioning is important when you're passing the parameters. I got to keep them as the same positioning as I did in the function. So first one I had was salary. Then I'll say, comma, pass in the bonus. Comma. And then I'm going to say pass in the output, which'll be my derived pay TOTAL_SAL.

And close by parentheses, and put in my semicolon. And I would need to do this on all of those events that I use. So not just bonus, but also on salary. And I'd also need to do this on my row init.

Save it. See how many opportunities I made. It doesn't appear to have any. So now, if I come over here back to my PIA and if I want to refresh this, test it again, if I do a search, and let's say I bring up a row of data, and I say base salary is $55,000, and the bonus was $500, here you see the new total bonus out here. So with this one, again, by using parameters I'm not handcuffed to only those certain fields from certain tables. I can use it to calculate anywhere where I need to add two fields and then return it into a third field.

We come back over here to our guide. Talking about using returns, returning a value. If you define a function using a returns clause, then you can call the function as an extension. So the function name, your parameter list, and then you see it returns a data type. Then you see your statement list, and you see in function.

The function can return any valid data type, including object data types. For example, the function could be called in an expression. Variable equals function name and parameters. So when we're looking at this, returning some kind of result. If we take a look at doing this one, if I come back over here and if I wanted to set this up using returns, if I go back in here to my Application Designer, and I go back into my PeopleCode for this function, I'm going to change this one to use returns. I'm going to say function CalcPay. And I'm going to say that this is going to be using salary and bonus as parameters that I'm going to have. These are my input parameters. And then I'm going to say returns a number.

And then over here where I execute it, I'm going to come in here and say, return, and then open my parentheses, ampersand salary. Oops. Over here. I'm trying to use it. Over here I'm going to say ampersand salary, plus ampersand bonus. Close with a semicolon, and function.

Now, notice, I didn't make a typo in here. Up here where you're putting in your function is the word returns. But inside your statement, when you get ready to return it, is the word return without the S.

Once I have this, let me validate. Looking good. I'll save it. And I'll close this back down. And if I come back over here to where I'm using it, now to rewrite this to use my returns, I'm going to come in here, and I'm going to say set my derived pay, total sal. And I'll say, this is going to be equal to. And I'll say use CalcPay. And I'll say, this is going to be passing in my SALARY comma my BONUS.

And I would copy this line. Go to my other events that need to use it, the bonus, FieldChange. And let's change this one here to use it as well.

And I'd go in here to my SALARY and change this one to use the return as well. And I'll validate to see how many typos I made. Looks like I didn't make any. You gotta love it when a plan comes together.

Now, of course, when I test this it's going to run exactly like it did before. There's not going to be any difference in the way that it executes. Or I should say what the user sees is what I mean by that.

So which way should I go and write my code? Should I use parameters? Or should I use returns? Which way should I code it going forward? Maybe you write it without any parameters.

Well, in the bottom line, it really doesn't matter which way you write it. Write it to the way you're most comfortable with. Returns ties you to a data type. So it's going to tie you to a specific data type.

Old languages typically are using parameters, but newer languages typically use returns. The only thing I would tell you is what not to do. And I would recommend that you don't create them without parameters, where you are hard coding what it's going to be using. I would either be using parameters, or I'd be using returns in parameters.

Oh, here's just another example of code where we're using returns. That brings us to an activity, Activity 15. You're going to be writing user defined functions. In this activity you'll review the activity overview, write user defined functions to modularize five programs you wrote in earlier activities. Once you complete Activity 15, that's going to conclude this lesson.

And review in this lesson, you learned that, by convention, you write external PeopleCode functions in special derived work record definitions designated as function libraries. These function libraries are named funclib underscore something by convention. By convention, you place your function definitions in the FieldFormula event. PeopleCode functions must be declared at the beginning of each program that uses them. Call PeopleCode functions by using the function name and passing all defined parameters. Parameters in a PeopleCode function are passed by reference, and therefore, can be treated as both input and output parameters.

Using the returns clause, you can write a function that can be invoked as an expression. That concludes Lesson 8, Writing User Defined Functions.
