Add Mode Processing. Searchinit runs, the user selects a key and SearchSave runs. Each row of data loaded into the buffer, applying RowSelect PeopleCode if the user entered a key that already existed. Normal spine processing, PreBuild, system defaults, FieldDefault, FieldFormula. And for each row of data in the buffer, the component applies RowInIt the the scroll or occurs level at which it is attached.

Finally, it'll run the PostBuild in activate, and it displays the component. So when we're looking at these normalized spine processing that we're talking about here, you see here it's going to run the SearchInIt. Then, you see adding the page in the key information. Normally, just keep in mind in add mode processing, normally there's no buffer to load. We're adding a new row of data.

If we take a look at where we're setting this up-- again, I think we looked at this earlier. But I go back to my training environment here and if I do a File, Open, and I say let's open up the record psupper definition search-- if we go to our upper ID and open up our PeopleCode, if I look over here on the Search Save, if I look at my SearchSave PeopleCode-- yeah, we looked at this earlier-- this is going to get executed when I'm adding a new row of data.

And as we looked at this earlier, you can see the different rules that we have inside here. Here you see, for example, if upperID is equal to pplsoft, then give them an error message. Well, if we come over here and to the PIA and I go to add a brand new user ID again-- let's say I add a new value and I put in pplsoft and I hit add, you can see that it comes and executes that SearchSave PeopleCode and gives me the invalid user ID. The user ID is a reserved user ID.

Explaining other processing flows, we have the Cancel Processing and Pop-Up Menu Processing. The component processor flow also includes cancel processing and pop-up menu processing with PeopleCode events. This was prior to release eight, we used this. Pop-up menu Processing.

While Pop-Up Menus and associated PeopleCode programs can still be created and maintained in PeopleSoft Application Designer, hyperlinks are the preferred methodology for implementing this type of functionality. So the pre pop-up and item selected events are not discussed or used inside of this course.

Server Trips. Every trip to the server takes time. In interactive mode, every field change forces a trip to the server. In deferred processing mode, fewer events cause server trips. Deferred processing results in an improved server and network performance, which has a positive impact on the user experience. Deferred processing is the default mode.

This table shows the effect of setting processing mode at the, component the page, or the page field level. So if we set the component to be interactive-- I'm looking at it from the bottom to the top. If I set the component to interactive, it really doesn't matter much what the page or the field says. If the component is interactive, everything in that component is interactive. Every page, every control.

But if I set my component to be in deferred mode, if I set the component to deferred mode, it defers the processing to the page. Now, if my page is set to interactive, I can add multiple pages in the component. I might have one page that is set to interactive. I might have another page that is set to deferred.

If the page is interactive, then it doesn't really matter what the page controls are set to. The entire page will be interactive. But if the other page in the component is set to deferred, what this really says is, I'm going to defer the processing to the individual page control. So it defers it to the field.

If a field is set to interactive, that one field will be interactive. When the user leaves the field, it will execute the field edit, field change PeopleCode, for example. If that field is set to deferred, then that field is deferred. So again, if the component is interactive, everything's interactive. If the component is deferred, then it defers to the page.

If the page is interactive, everything on that page is interactive. If the pages is deferred then it defers it to the individual page controls. And if the page control is deferred, it's deferred. If it's interactive, it's interactive.

Refresh Button and Expert Entry options. The Refresh Button and Expert Entry options on the Component Properties, Internet Tab provides ways for you to give the user more control. The Refresh Button option displays a Refresh Button on the component, which allows the user to force a server trip.

The Allow Expert Entry option displays an Expert Entry checkbox on the component when Expert Entry is also enabled on the user profile. When the Expert Entry check box on the component is selected, the component runs in deferred mode regardless of the component settings in the PeopleSoft Application Designer.

When the Expert Entry check box on the component is deselected, the component runs in the mode specified for the component in PeopleSoft Application Designer. This table lists the user interactions that causes a trip to the server. Action enter data in fields with FieldEdit or FieldChange PeopleCode.

Can it be deferred? Yes. Enter data in fields that have prompt table edits can be deferred. Enter data in fields that have related displays can be deferred. But the rest of these are not going to be able to be deferred. Inserting or deleting a row from a grid or scroll always forces a trip. Using the grid or scroll controls to move forward or backwards or selecting another page tab in the grid tab forces a trip.

Expanding or collapsing a collapsible section. Clicking any button, link, or icon on the page. Or clicking the Refresh button, or using the keyboard equivalent, none of those can be deferred. If we take a look back over here to our training environment as a quick review of deferred versus interactive, if I come over to my component for my student application-- so I'm just going to come over here and do a File, Open, Component, PSU_student.

In the first page, the first option that controls the processing is the component. If I go to my Components Properties and I click on the Internet tab, you'll notice on my internet tab, you'll see the options, over on the right that says Processing Mode, Interactive versus Deferred. Now, if my component was set to interactive- let's just change this one for a moment and I hit OK-- it says it doesn't much care what any of the pages say.

So notice that this one has a page as a student personnel that is set to Interactive. Notice over the column, Allow Deferred Processing is not selected. And we have a page, PSU Student Skills and Education where it is selected. But if the component is interactive, we don't care about this.

If I come back over here to my PIA-- and let's go back in to our Student Personal Information. And if I do a search and I select on Student 2001-- notice if I come over and say we belong to a customer, let's say, yyy, when I put this in, it says, sorry about that. That's not a valid value.

And you can see that this ran instantly as soon as I left the field. If I come over here and say you belong to xyz and tab out of here, it immediately validates and brings back the related display. If I go to Education and Skills, if I say you get a skill in, let's say, XXX, and I leave this field inside here, immediately I get an opportunity. Invalid value.

So this is an example that now, we're seeing that both pages are running in interactive mode. If I change this scale back to CSA, as soon as I tab out, it removes the error and updates the description. If I come back over here to my Application Designer and I go back to my Properties, I go back to my internet tab, and I'm going to say, run this in deferred mode.

Again, if I said that component to run in deferred mode, that says I'm deferring to the page. And here, I can see that the student's personnel page is interactive. This one is deferred. If I double click on one of these pages, I can look at where we set it up on the page if we go to the page's properties.

And I come in here, and I go to my Use tab. Here, you can see, Allow Deferred Processing. So this one is running in deferred mode. Now, if I come back over here to my component and save it, if I come back over here to my PIA and go back into that Student Personal Information, and if I did a search, I come over here at 2001-- notice if I change the customer to be CONS, immediately when I leave here this is interactive, so it changed the consulting services for the related field.

If I go to Education and Skills, and have I say, skill is xxx, soon as I tab the field, it did nothing. Nothing. Why? Because now we are running in Deferred Processing Mode. Now, if I hit my Refresh, or I hit the lookup, or I hit the plus sign insert a new row, it'll make a trip to the server and catch the opportunity.

In addition, we could go over here and open up a page control field that is running in deferred. And I can say I want to change this. I could go to the Skill column, and I could say, let's set this field to run in interactive mode. So I could say I want this one to run interactive.

I hit OK. I hit save. Now, if I come back over here, if the component is running in deferred and the page is running in deferred, it defers the processing to the page control. So if I come in here and I look at a row of data and go to Education and Skills Now, and say we have a skill of xxx, now you see this one field is running interactive, but the rest of the fields on the page would be running in deferred.

If I back over here to my Nav Bar and go to my Navigator-- all right, let's go to Recent Places. If I go back into my User Profiles and take a look at PTCode, here, you'll notice there's an entry out here for Allow Expert Entry. If I check this and save it, now that says I'm an expert. And I'll hit OK on this message. Of course, most people already know I'm an expert.

But if I come back over here and go back to my Application Designer, and I'm going to go back to my component and go to my internet tab. And over here, I can say, Allow Expert Entry. If I allow expert entry, what that allows me to do is override running any of the pages out here in interactive mode. And I can run them in deferred.

So I'm going to allow expert entry and hit OK. Remember, student personnel is an interactive page. I want to save this. If I come back over here to my PIA and go back into my personal information-- now, if I come in there and do a search and I select Mark Lawson, if I come over here to customer and I say, let's make that yyy, hey, what happened to my opportunity?

Well, even though this page is set to run interactive, I'm an expert, and I have overridden it to run in deferred. Look down here at the bottom below your push buttons. You see, the Expert Entry is selected. Again, it allows the user to take more control. Maybe it's an expert. They know what they're doing.

If I remove it, it'll go back to running interactive as the page suggested. Brings us to a couple of activities that we have here. So we have activity nine, examining deferred processing. In this activity, you'll review the activity overview and look at the settings to control deferred processing for the component, the page, and the field.

We also have activity 10, reviewing the programs that synchronize student addresses with customer addresses. In this activity, you'll review the activity overview and look at how PeopleCode is used to synchronize PSU student table with the PSU customer table. Once you have completed those activities, that will be wrapping up this lesson.

So in review of this lesson, you learned that the component processor flow can be divided into seven general processing sequences-- search, component build and page display, field actions, row actions, save actions, cancel, pop-up menu. Events are pre-defined exit points in the component processor flow.

The PeopleCode search events are SearchInIt and SearchSave. The PeopleCode component build and page display events are a RowSelect, PreBuild, FieldDefault, FieldFormula, RowInIt, PostBuild, and activate. The PeopleCode field action events are FieldEdit and FieldChange.

The PeopleCode row action events are RowInsert, RowDelete. The PeopleCode save action events are SaveEdit, SavePreChange, Workflow, and SavePostChange. The component processor flow is different for add mode processing, because instead of selecting an existing key, the user defines a new key. Deferred processing improves performance for PeopleSoft applications, but it can negatively affect the user experience.

That concludes lesson four.
