Evaluate constructs-- when several different possible values of a variable or field need to be analyzed, an Evaluate construct may be a more straightforward approach than a series of If constructs. So syntax for Evaluate-- Evaluate left term When. And then you see the right term, statement list. Then you see another When right term, statement list; When-Other, then the statement list; End-Evaluate.

At times, the different possible values of a variable or field may need to be analyzed. Based upon these values, different logic may need to be performed. Many nested If constructs could be used, but the code would be complex. A single Evaluate statement can check all possible values of a field. An Evaluate construct is a more straightforward approach than using a series of If constructs.

In an Evaluate construct, one field or variable is evaluated for all possible values. Every Evaluate construct must end with an End-Evaluate clause. Evaluate constructs have four clauses. The When-Other clause is optional.

So you have the Evaluate the field or variable that's to be evaluated. When-- include one for each possible value. Values can be referenced more than once. Optionally, you have When-Other-- the action should be performed when field or variable isn't any of the values specified in the When clauses. And then you have the End-Evaluate.

An Evaluate construct can have unlimited When clauses. The standard PeopleCode relational operators are used in the When clause. If no relational operator is specified, then equal to is assumed.

Note-- the syntax of the Evaluate construct is similar to the Evaluate statement in SQR or Switch or Case in other languages. However, the logic is different. In PeopleCode, When clauses are always evaluated against the original value of the field or variable from the beginning of the construct. If you assign a new value to the field or variable within the Evaluate construct, then the original value is still used for the comparisons. In SQR, if you assign a variable a new value within the Evaluate construct, subsequent evaluations are performed using the new value.

So if we take a look here, what's it talking about? For example, you see there's a VAR that's equal to 5. It says, Evaluate VAR When greater than 1. So it would be saying, is the VAR greater than 1?

5 is greater than 1. So it says, VAR is equal to VAR plus 9. So VAR plus 9-- 5 plus 9-- would mean it's going to be equal to 14.

Then it says, When equal to 5-- well, VAR is equal to 5. So it says, VAR is going to be equal to VAR plus 10. So 10 plus 14 would be 24.

Then it says, When it's equal to 24, set the VAR to be equal to 222. When-Other, VAR is equal to 7; End-Evaluate. What do we got going on here?

Well, the final value of the VAR is going to be 24. So again it uses what is evaluated, the value coming into the Evaluate. It's 5, so it does each of those When conditions being done, and, of course, accumulating the value.

Implied Boolean Or-- multiple When clauses with no code between them act as an implied Boolean Or statement. So for example, Evaluate var When equal to A; When equal to B. Since we have no statement after the When equal to A, it's going to imply an Or statement there, which means when it's equal to A or B, do the statement last. When equal to C, do statement list number 2; End-Evaluate.

The same statements can be executed for multiple When clauses. Assume three possible values for a field-- A, B, and C. If the value is either A or B, then one statement looks to be executed. But if the value is C, then a different statement is being executed.

Break statements-- a Break statement terminates the execution of a branching or looping construct. So for example, you see Evaluate RECORD.FIELD When equal to 1 or When equal to 2-- remember the implied Or-- the statement list 1 and then Break.

And when we say Break, it says, go to the end of Evaluate. It says, don't keep on moving here. We've already got it. It was either 1 or 2. Let's just Break and go to the bottom.

If it was not a 1 or 2, then it will say When equal to 3. If its equal to 3, do statement list 2 and Break, go to the bottom. If it's not equal to 1, 2, or 3, then it'll go to When-Other and launch statement list number 3 and end the Evaluate.

A Break statement can be used to exit any looping construct or an Evaluate construct. If the loop or Evaluate block is nested within another loop or Evaluate block, the Break applies to the inner construct only. So here it says, the following example demonstrates the use of an Evaluate block with Break statements.

Here, we're looking at a component out here called PSU_EMP_REVIEW. And we're on the PSU_EMP REVIEW_TYPE field on FieldChange. And we're saying, Evaluate the PSU_EMP_RVW_RVR.REVIEW_TYPE.

When it's equal to an S, meaning the supervisor, set the DERIVED.EDITABLE equal to PSU_SUPVR_VW-- so setting in this prompt table to use PSU_SUPVR_VW. Break-- don't continue looking through the Evaluate. Break, don't do anything else.

But if it wasn't equal to an S, was it equal to an F, or was it equal to a P? If it's an F or a P, set the DERIVED.EDITABLE equal to PERSONAL_DATA. So PERSONAL_DATA would be the prompt table it prompts to, then Break. If it wasn't equal to S, or F, or P-- When equal to E, set the PERSONAL_DATA. to NONE. And we're going to set the REVIEWER_ID.Value to the PSU_EMP_RVW_RVR.EMPLID and disable the field.

However, a Break statement typically would not be allowed by the syntax checker within an If block. However, when the If block is nested within a loop or an Evaluate block, then a Break is allowed and can be used to exit the loop or Evaluate block containing the If block. So here you see an example of that down here.

So here, you see we got an If statement-- For &I equals 1 to RS.ActiveRowCount. In here, it's getting one row at a time for a record from PSU_STU_ENROLL. Set the Course to be equal to the COURSE field. Set the Status to ENROLL_STATUS. PreReqStart-- RS.GetRow &I, get the record from the CRS_SESSN for the START_DATE.Value

If the Course.Value is equal to 1002 And the Status.Value is equal to enrolled Or Status.Value is equal to completed, Then If PreReqStart date is less than StartDate, Then Completed equals True. And then you see the Break being inside the nested If statements.

Logical expressions-- a logical expression is a PeopleCode expression that will evaluate to either True or False. Logical expressions can be used in If constructs, Evaluate constructs, and looping constructs. Logical expressions can also be used anywhere a value of True or False is expected. So if we look, down here is an example that they're showing us.

Negating Boolean values-- so the following examples demonstrate two methodologies for negating a Boolean value. So negating a Boolean value using the Not operator-- you see we're declaring a variable &Flag of type Boolean. We're saying, &Flag is equal to True.

&Flag equals Not Flag. Well, the Flag is now set to False, changing whatever the value it was originally. If Not Flag Then WinMessage "Flag equals False." So if Flag is not True, say Flag is equal to False, End-If.

Then you see negating a Boolean value by comparing it to False-- so declaring a variable Flag as Boolean, setting the Flag is equal to True. Flag is equal to Flag is equal to False-- could have just said Flag equals False. If Not Flag Then WinMessage "Flag equals False."

Here, it shows you more logical expressions in an Evaluate construct. So if we look at this one right here, Var is equal to 5; Evaluate True. And that's your again Boolean. When Var is greater than or equal to 1-- so when 5 is greater than or equal to 1-- and Var is less than or equal to 10-- so when 5 is less than 10-- it says, WinMessage "Range of values." So it's going to write a message saying "Range of values."

Drops down, says, When Var is equal to 1-- well, it's not, 5 is not equal to 1-- Or Var is equal to 3-- well, 5 is not equal to 3-- Or Var is equal to 5-- well, 5 does equal 5. So it's going to come back and it says "List of values." So it's going to print that to the screen.

When Var is equal to 2-- 5 equal to 2? No, don't think so. Or Var is greater than 4-- so 5 is greater than 4-- And Var is less than or equal to 15-- 5 is less than or equal to 15-- so write the message "Combination of ranges and lists." So what gets written here is all three statements are true. So the user would get three messages being displayed onto their screen.

Looping constructs-- PeopleCode uses three types of looping constructs. We have a While loop, a Repeat loop, and a For loop. When it comes to While loops and Repeat loops, these are Boolean loops. For loops are iteration loops.

So here it's showing us a While loop continues to loop as long as the logical expression evaluates to True. Multiple conditions can be incorporated using the Boolean logic-- While something, statement list, End-While. A While loop evaluates the logical expression at the beginning of the loop. Therefore, the loop might not execute even once if that condition is False.

Repeat loops-- a Repeat loop executes until a logical expression evaluates to True. Because the condition is tested at the end of the loop, the loop will always execute at least once if it is invoked-- so Repeat statement list Until and then what we're comparing. It says, a Repeat loop performs its logical check after the statements within the loop have executed.

What is the difference between While and Repeat loops? When would you use which? Well, a While loop is useful if the possibility exists that the loop should never execute, that is the loop could execute 0 or more times. Repeat loop is used when you always need it to execute at least one time. In general, these two loops are more flexible than For loops since the logical check can be any Boolean expression rather than being constrained to checking against an incremented number.

For loops-- these are not like COBOL, where I would have to declare an integer. Don't have to initialize an integer. Don't have to do any increment when we're setting up For loops in PeopleCode. You can, but you don't have to.

A For loop executes a specific number of times based upon start, end, and step values. A For looping construct terminates with an End-For clause. So here, you see For count equals expression To expression, your Step counter, statement list; End-For.

So I could come in here and maybe-- let's say I come out here and I could say something like, For &I equals-- and I could say, 1 To 10. And then I could have a statement of whatever I wanted to execute. And then I would have my End-For.

In this case, &I does not have to be declared ahead of time, initialized before the statement. If I don't declare it, it'll declare just the type Any. And it'll automatically get initialized to the 1.

First time through, it's equal to 1. Then at auto-increments. If I don't tell it what to increment by, it automatically increment by 1. So this would execute 10 times.

I could go over here and I could say, For &I equals-- and I could say, 1 To 10. And I could say, Step by 2. And then I could have my statements, and I could add my End-For.

In this case, it's going to be stepping by 2 instead of stepping by 1. So the first time when it executes, I is equal to 1. Second time it executes, I is equal to 3.

The next one, I is equal to 5. The fourth time, I is equal to 7, and the fifth time, I is equal to 9, and that is done. So it's going to execute five times.

I could even do this with negatives. I could come over here and say, For &I is equal to-- and I could just do it the opposite way. I can say, 10 To 1 Step minus 2. And I can put in my statement and my End-For listed right here. So this one right here would still execute five times, but this time it would start with 10 and go down by 2.

Come back over here to our guide here. Activity 11-- selecting the correct PeopleCode events for error messages. In this activity, you review the activity overview and select the correct events in which to place PeopleCode to enforce three business rules that we will have.

And once you complete this activity-- in reviewing this lesson, you learned that PeopleCode programs are made up of PeopleCode statements, which can be comments, declarations, assignments, program constructs, method invocations, and function invocations. PeopleCode supports conditional branching using If constructs and Evaluate constructs. The three types of PeopleCode loops are While loops, Repeat loops, and For loops. That concludes lesson 5.
