"Using the PeopleCode Debugger-- Features of the PeopleCode Debugger." That PeopleCode Debugger has the following features-- it's integrated into Application Designer; visual breakpoint indicator; ability to step through code; single debugger instance; variable panes allow you to inspect values and variables and function parameters; and PeopleCode objects can be expanded so you can inspect their members' properties and methods. So with the PeopleCode Debugger, you basically turn it on, set breakpoints, and then you go test. When it hits a breakpoint, you can inspect what's in the buffer. You can change the values of variables once you're inside it looking at the code.

"Setting up the Debugging Environment." You can use the PeopleCode Debugger to debug PeopleCode programs attached to application pages, component interfaces, or application engine programs. You can have one debug instance per login.

If you are debugging an application in PeopleSoft Pure Internet Architecture, you must run PeopleSoft Application Designer in three-tier mode through the application server. In addition, you must be signed on in the browser and in the PeopleSoft Application Designer using the same user ID. If you are debugging Application Engines or component interface PeopleCode, you run the PeopleSoft Application Designer in two-tier mode with a direct connection to the database.

Let's go over here and take a look at this in our training environment. Come back over here and if I sign into my debugger. So I can come in here and sign into by first signing into Application Designer. And I'll sign in in three-tier mode, so I'm going to change the connection type to be Application Server. And I'll use my user ID PTCODE, and I'll hit OK here, and I'm going to come in here.

And kind of don't want to see that Property window anymore, and I want to open up that project, so I'm going to come over and go to my Tools and Options and set my Reload Last Project and when definitions modified. And if I go to the General tab, I'll disable the Property window for the next time when I sign in.

And I'll go ahead and open up the project I did earlier. I believe this is something you did in one of your activities earlier, so yours should already be set here. But what I'm going to do is I'm going to come in here and I'm going to open up a record in here. I'm going to say open up the record PSU_PurchaseOrderDetail, and I'll open this one. And I'm going to maximize this and close down my Property window for now.

And once I have this one opened here, you see I got a bold field called order line number. I'm going to right-click and say show me the PeopleCode. And when I come in here to the PeopleCode, here you see my record field order line number PeopleCode. And here I can choose an event. I'm going to go to the even called RowInsert, when you go to insert a new row of data into the table. And I'm going to use this one.

I'm going to go into Debug on here to give myself a little bit more room before I go in here. I'm going to do the Alt-1 to close my Output window. And to get to the debugger, you come over here to the menu bar called Debug. Who would have ever thunk it? And I say Enter My Debug Mode.

When I enter My Debug Mode, I can resize these windows that you have in here. So I might make this one a little bigger here. This is the call stack for where I'm at inside the program. You see I got local variables.

But if I come over to Debug, I can say show me more information. I could come in here and say, I tell you what, show me my component variables. I could say show me global variables, or I could say show me function parameters, or here I'm going to say View Component Buffers. And I'll just resize this a little bit more again. There's my call stack area, and I'll make it a little smaller here.

So it gives me the different things I want to look at. And I'll make this one a little bigger for the buffers. But when I go and I set up what I want to look at, you don't have to open them up ahead of time. You could open them up as you're in the debug of whatever you want to take a look at.

But here I could go in and put in a breakpoint. Now breakpoint is saying when we get to this point in the code, take me in here and let me look at the code line by line perhaps. So I could come in here and say if Line is greater than Max Line, then-- and if I set my focus on that line, I can go to My Debug, and I can say let's set up a breakpoint on here, or I could just hit F9. Now I have a breakpoint here, and when I go to do testing, this says that I want it to stop when I get to this location.

If I come over here, and let me go into the PIA-- I come in here. If I go to my-- You've got to sign in as the same user as you did in the three-tier Application Designer. But if I come over to my Navigator and I go to My Purchasing and I go into My Maintain Purchase Orders, I'm just going to do a search and bring up the first row that I see here.

And if I come in here and I hit the plus sign to insert a new row of code. When I hit the plus sign, it gives me this modal window of how many rows you want. I'm just going to say one. And when I hit OK to insert this, it takes me into Application Designer. And you'll notice when I come into Application Designer, you see up here you see this arrow pointing to me that I'm currently on the breakpoint. So it's saying where are you currently at in the code.

Now if you look down here, you'll see we have the call stack. So when I'm looking at the call stack you're seeing right here, it displays a stack of your PeopleCode functions and methods that are currently active but not yet completed. So you can use the Call Stack pane to observe the flow of the application as it executes this through a series of nested functions. When a function is called, it gets pushed into the top of the stack. When the function returns, it gets popped off the stack.

So here we can take a look at seeing where we are currently inside here on this purchase order detail number RowInsert. Statement line 3 is where we're at. If I look down here, you can see my local variables that we have. So I have a local variable Max Line, &I, and line number, and I can see their values. Right now it's Max Line is 0, &I I is equal to 1, and &line is also equal to 1.

And you can also come over here and hover over a line. So if I come over here and I hover over the values up here, like if I hover over the &I, notice you can see right here it's equal to 1. I could come over here, and I can hover over lines equal to 1. I can hover over Max Line is equal to 0. If I hover over line number inside the table, it's currently equal to 0. So here I can take a look at this information from inside here.

If I look over here in my component buffer, I can take a look at what's going on in the buffer. If I expand this, here it says you're on your level 0 row set, and here I can see the different properties that we have available for a row set and their attributes.

Here I can see it's working with a primary record from PSU Purchase Order Header. And if I look down here at Component, this row set is made up of rows. So row sets are made up of rows.

If I expand to Get Row when you're at level 0, you only have one row of data. And here it says-- here's your row that you're looking at. If I expand this row, you'll see for a row the different properties that we have on the row-- is changed, is deleted, selected. So I can see information about properties that are available on a row.

A row is made up of row sets or records. And here you can see-- if I look down here, you can see Get Record. And if I expand the Get Record, I can see the records are being listed at level 0. So at level 0 on this page, I got the Purchase Order Header, the Transport table, the Vendor table, the Derived Education Services.

Records are made up of fields. So if I expand the Purchase Order Header, I can see the properties, first of all for this record-- is deleted, is changed. And then if I look further down, you see Get Field. And now if I expand Fields, I can see the different fields that are in the record-- so Business Unit, Order Number, Order Date.

And I can see what's in the buffer for these. So right now, the data I'm looking at is Business Unit ASPL1 Order 29. So I can see the information as we go through this.

If I collapse that, we said when I'm dealing with a row set, row sets are made up of rows. Rows are made up of records or row sets. So here you see the record. But if I look down here, you can also see that we got row sets for a row, and that would be my level 1. And here you can see at level 1, the primary record is the Purchase Order Detail. And again, I can see the methods for it, and I can drill further down inside here.

So I could take inside of here, and I can say get me the row of data, the first row of data, for the level 1 row set. And here it says OK. We got three rows out here, but here's the first row. If I look at it, here again I can see the methods for the row.

And here you see rows are made up of records. If I look at the record, I can see the primary record for level 1 is Purchase Order Detail. Here's the properties. And then I can look at fields that are inside here.

Other things you can do from inside here is I can go up here on My Debug menu, and I can go in here and set up options in the debugger. So here in the debugger, I could come in here and say I want to set up log options, and I could say I want to set up a log out here for maybe each statement that we go through. So here's where you can set up Execution, Call Trace, Data Trace, List Programs, Log a File. I'm just going to hit OK.

And when I'm in here, I could step through the lines of code. So I could come in here. If you look at the debug, right now you see I'm on "if Line is equal to Max Line, Line is equal to 1. Max Line is equal to 0." So if Line is greater than Max Line, what do we want to do?

Well, if I go to My Debug, I can step through these lines of code inside here. So I can step into by doing an F8, or step over. Maybe if it's a function and I don't want to debug the function itself, I could do a F10 or I could do a F5 to just go. But I'm going to come in here, and I could do a F8 to step through the line. Now I can see Max Line is equal to Line.

Once I execute this, I can come in here and see what's going to happen here. So I could go over here to line, and maybe if I wanted to change values, you could go in and make changes to the values in here. I could say let's change that instead of a 1 to be a 2. And I could change it directly when I'm in here. Then I hit my F8 walk through the lines of code here.

When I'm done debugging this, I could come back over here in My Debug, and I could say let's edit my breakpoints. If I didn't want any of these breakpoints, I could remove them. Hit OK. I could go back over here to My Debug and go to My Options, and I could turn off the debugging into the log file for each statement. And if I wanted to look at the log file, I could hit my Alt-1 again to show the log file to take a look at those statements that we have. You'll do this in an activity in a little bit.

But I could come over here now, and I could go to My Debug and I could say abort running the program to exit out of the Debug. And once I've told it to abort running the program, I could go in here and start closing some of these windows down.

Here you see the log file where I was writing the information to the log as I went through it. And if I'm completely done with this, I could exit out of the Debugger.

So that's setting up your debug environment. "Activity 3, Debugging PeopleCode Programs." In this activity, you will review the activity overview and investigate the features of the PeopleCode Debugger.
