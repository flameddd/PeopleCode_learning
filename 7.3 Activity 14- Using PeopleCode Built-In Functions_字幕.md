Activity 14, Using PeopleCode Built-In Functions. In this activity, we'll review the activity overview and use built-in functions to issue warnings for specific conditions on the task page. Activity Overview-- in this activity, you will enhance the task page.

You will issue a warning that managerial approval must be obtained if the user attempts to modify the task end date by more than three months, if the task end date is left blank, or if the current date exceeds the start date in the total effort allocated is greater than zero, but the task effort spent equals zero. This scenario implies that the task should have started but hasn't yet, because no effort has been recorded.

Number two, from now on, when displaying an error or warning message to the user, add the text to the message catalog, and retrieve it using a function, such as message get. The message catalog is maintained through the browser on the Message Catalog page. Select PeopleTools, Utilities, Administration, Message Catalog. Create Message Sent number 30420 to store the messages for this course.

Number three, remember to analyze which field or fields need to be made interactive and which PeopleCode events will need to be invoked to meet the business requirements. And number four, to test your programs, we'll go in and select the Training Task task table. Select the first task, task 1, to test two separate scenarios. First, we'll change the end date by more than three months. Then we'll remove the value from the end date.

We'll click Next in List to go to task 2, and we'll test the scenario in which the start date has passed but no effort has been recorded.

Activity Detailed Steps-- perform the detailed steps to complete the activity, issuing warnings regarding the task end date. To warn the user that managerial approval must be obtained when attempting to modify the task end date by more than three months. Change the End Date field to be interactive on PSU task page. Create a message set, and add two messages to the message catalog. So we'll go into PeopleTools, Utilities, Administration, Message Catalog.

We'll click on Add a New Value tab. For the message set, we'll do 30420. We'll enter a description for the message set, PeopleCode Course, no short description required. We'll enter the following information for the message text-- "Enter an end date for this task." Add another row. Enter another message out here-- "Manager approval must be obtained to modify the end date by more than three months." And we'll press Save. So let's do that first.

So if I come back over here to the PIA, if I go to my nav bar, go to my Navigator, if I go back to my root level and go to my PeopleTools folder, and from here, if I go to Utilities, from here, if I go into Administration, and from here, I'll choose the Message Catalog. Want to save my changes? Nope, I do not. And I'll put in the message catalog. I'll click on Add to add a new value, and I'll put in the Message Catalog 30420. I'll click Add.

It says, what description do you want to use for this one? I believe we said PeopleCode Course. Short Description we'll just leave blank, and we'll come in here for our first message. We'll put in the text, "Enter an end date for this task."

I'll hit the plus sign on the scroll to insert another message here, message number two. I'll put in "Managerial approval must be obtained to modify end date by more than three months." And we'll hit Save.

Creating your PeopleCode in the following location, so we'll create PeopleCode out here on our PSU Task component. Go to our PSU Task table withinside it on the End Date field, and we'll do field edit PeopleCode. So if I come over here, and I'll close what I have open. And I'll open up my component, my PSU Task component.

And if I go to my structure, if I take a look at this one, I'm going to go to my field, and I'll use the End Date field. And I'll say, View PeopleCode. And we're doing validation, so we'll put this on the field, Edit Event. Basic logic that we want to do is I want to go out here, and I want to keep up with what was the value before the user makes the change.

So I'm going to create a variable in here. I'll say, let's create a variable. We'll say local. We'll say this is of type date, and we'll name it &prior. And I'll say, if none in my end date field, then, meaning if there's not a value in there, we'll give them a warning message. Warning.

And we'll say, let's do a message get. Go to our catalog, 30420, and use the message I just created, message number one. And I can come in here and follow it up inside here. Message not found.

Please enter an end date for this task. This message will only get displayed to the user if it doesn't find the message in the message catalog. Else, so if there is an end date out here, then we're going to go and check to see if it's within the 30 days. So I'm going to say, else. I'm going to say, &prior. I'm going to say &prior is equal to, and I'll say, use the function prior value. And we'll say for the End Date field.

Then I'll say, if there is a value in my prior, then we'll do our logic. We'll say, if our end date is greater than, and we'll use one of our functions. We'll say Add to Date, and we'll say, add to the date, and we'll say &prior, comma, and then we'll say 0, comma, 3, comma, 0, and meaning three months out here. Or if our end date is less than add to date, and we'll say, &prior, comma, 0, comma, minus 3, so in either direction, comma, 0.

Then we'll give them a warning, message get. We'll say, use our message 30420, message number two. And we'll say, message not found. Manager Approval must be obtained to modify end date by more than three months.

And if-- and end our if, our previous if, and end our first if. And check for my typos. Oh, looks like I did good again. So again, we're looking first to see if they entered an end date. If not, we'll give them the warning saying you've got to have an end date.

Else, if they did put in, we'll get the value of whatever the end date used to be, and as long as there was a value in that end date, then we'll go out there and check to see if there was anything within that time period that we set up, saying we want to make sure that it has to be within that three months, either prior or in the future, one or the other.

Save what we got. And back over here to our guide. To test your program, it says, from the recent places like the task table, alternatively, select Setup, Training, Training, Task Test Table. Select the first Task 1 to test two separate scenarios. First, change the end date by more than three months, and press the Tab key to navigate out of the field. So if we come over here, and let's do that.

If I did a search and select a row of data, and if I come over here to the end date, and let's say I make this one-- how about 10/23/2002? And when I come in here, notice that nothing happened when I did that. Well, one of the things I need to check is, did I make sure that this was running in interactive mode?

So I might not have. So I'm going to come back over here, go back into my page. And if I go to my End Date field, and I go to Use, let's turn that deferred processing off. That will have an effect on me, won't it? I'll hit OK, and I'll hit my Save. I'll hit my OK, and let's go out here and test this.

So if we come over here and test this in our PIA, if I go back to my nav bar, go back to my recent places, and go back into my task table again, and I do a search, and, thus, bring back up that Task 1, and let's hope for better results this time. If I come in there and change this to be 010 and tab out of here, ah, that looks a lot better.

Warning-- managerial approval must be obtained to modify end date by more than three months. If I hit OK, it says I then remove the value from the end date and press the Tab key to navigate again. So if I come back over here, and I remove that, and I tab out of here, it says, warning, enter an end date for this task. Gotcha.

What happens if I came over here and-- I'm going to return to search. And I select on this task again, and this time, I say, how about 01/23/2002? I should get my warning again, because, again, the prior value, the three months afterwards or before.

So here, it says again, hey, you've modified it by more than three months. Shame on you. So I'll return to my search. So this is when the end date is changed by more than three months, the following warning displayed. When the end date is removed, the following warning is displayed. And we just noticed that ourselves.

So issue a warning for in-progress tasks when the task effort spent equals zero. This scenario implies that the task should have started, but it hasn't yet, because no effort has been recorded. Oh, the shame of it all.

To issue this warning, add another message to the Message Catalog. We'll add it for message 30420. And we'll add a new line-- start date has passed, and no work has begun. So if we come back out here to our PIA and go back to our nav bar and go back to our message catalog, 30420, and I'll go in here and add a new message, message number three. And I'll say, start date has passed. And no work has begun.

I'll save it. Now if I come back in here to our guide, create your PeopleCode program. You want to put this on your task component for PSU Task Saved Edit, so we come back over to App Designer, and I'll just close this page. And I'll go-- do I still have PeopleCode open? I sure do. I'll come in here, and I'll hit my drop-down, and I'll go to my PSU task. And I'll hit my drop-down and go to my Save Edit. And we'll add some new code inside of here.

So in this case, I'm going to come in here and say, if all, inside my start date, and I'm also going to check to see if there's something inside my effort total. Then, we'll say, if, and I'll say my-- and I'm going to use my %date to say compared to today's date. If my %date is greater than my start date and none inside my effort spent.

Then let's go out and give them a warning. We'll say, do a message get, 30420, message number 3. We'll say, message not found. And do my end-if, end-if. Check my typos, and never went this far without a typo. So again, if we're looking at it here, we're saying if there is something in the start date, and there's something in the effort total, and if today's date is greater than the start date, and there's no value in the effort spent, then let's give them a warning.

I'll save it. It says, continue testing on the task page. Click Next in the list, and navigate to Task 02. Test the scenario on which the start date has passed, but no effort has been recorded by modifying some data on the page, such as the end date or start date, but not the effort spent. So if we come back over here to our PIA. And of course, I'm no longer on that page, so I'm going to have to get to that page.

So if I come over here and go to my-- come back in here to be able to test this one, I go back into my task table, do a search, select task number two here, and if I go in here and want to make a change to this one, here, you see, I got my date inside here. And we'll make a change inside here.

So if I come over here, and let's say I change a date field. I'm leaving that effort spent blank. And if change this in, let's say, 2003, and I go to hit Save, "Warning-- manager approval must be obtained to modify end date by more than three months."

I'll hit my OK. Warning-- the start date has passed, and new work has begun. And that's the one we was looking to find. Come back over here. So here, "Warning-- start date's passed. No work has begun." That's the last one we seen. This concludes the activity. Please do not continue.
