Lesson 2, technology overview. Our objectives, by the end of this lesson, you'll be able to describe PeopleCode, how PeopleCode is used, where PeopleCode is used, and how to find information about PeopleCode in PeopleSoft Online Help, and PeopleCode conventions.

Proprietary language for PeopleSoft application development, PeopleCode is Oracle's proprietary, integrated programming language for PeopleSoft application development. PeopleCode touches every aspect of PeopleSoft applications.

PeopleCode is used to control the presentation of information to the user and validate user inputs, perform calculations and manipulate data, maintain data integrity update database tables, manage portal navigation and administer security, integrate with other PeopleSoft applications and with third-party applications, and manage workflow.

So, as we go through this course, we'll see throughout the course many different places where PeopleCode is being used, whether we're adding a new user and using PeopleCode to assign a next number for it or maybe when we're cross-comparing fields inside a page for validation purposes. Or, maybe for referential integrity, if we change the data in this location, make sure you change this corresponding row of data in some other location.

PeopleCode is used in the component processor flow on components, pages, record fields, and menus. And this will be our focus of the class. So, when a user goes into a field, they make a change or whatever they're doing. They tab out of the field. Make sure that data is consistent, follows our business rules. Our focus is on the user's experience. And that's what we'll be looking at primarily in this class is this very first bullet point, the component processor flow.

PeopleSoft Application Engine programs is another place we make use of PeopleCode for batch solutions. We won't be looking at PeopleCode in Applications Engines in the PeopleSoft PeopleCode course. That'll be covered in the PeopleSoft application engine course.

We have integration, integration through component interfaces in PeopleSoft Integration Broker. So this is another separate course that we have that goes over this. PeopleCode is used to publish and subscribe to the transaction. So we have a couple courses-- PeopleSoft integration tools, part 1, and PeopleSoft integration tools, part 2.

Workflow, so workflow is about automating something. We have a separate course for the workflow as well. And then we have sign-on security where PeopleCode is being used. And we have a separate course that goes over security. So we have a PeopleSoft security course.

But the bottom line, what we're trying to focus on here, is PeopleCode is used everywhere. We have the component processor, which is, basically, our interactive processing. We have our Application Engine, which is one of our batch processing tools that we use. We have component interfaces to interfacing with three-- or interfacing out there with third-party programs or maybe between different PeopleSoft applications. We have the-- and that makes use of the Integration Broker.

We have workflow. We have some security, sign-on security. And there's quite a bit more things that we have out here. And you can read through your student notes at your leisure to get a little bit more info on what these other places that we use PeopleCode is.

PeopleCode in PeopleSoft Online Help, we have three PeopleBooks that are dealing with PeopleCode, that PeopleTools 8.57 PeopleCode Developer's Guide covers the concepts of PeopleCode, including techniques for adding PeopleCode applications, tips for using PeopleCode, the interaction of PeopleCode and the component processor, the PeopleCode debugger, referencing data in the component buffer.

Sometimes, we like to refer to the Developer's Guide as being the how-to book, how to make use of objects, how to make use of classes, et cetera. The accompanying subject areas have PeopleTools 8.57 PeopleCode API Reference and the PeopleTools 8.57 PeopleCode Language Reference are a complete reference of the PeopleCode language. Their topics describe the syntax and fundamental elements of the PeopleCode language.

The API Reference guide is a guide on classes. We have over 50 classes that we have in PeopleSoft. So this will go over those different classes that we have for our object-oriented programming for example.

We have a Language Reference guide. It's a listing of functions by category or alphabetically. It would give us information on the meta-SQL that we have inside of PeopleCode.

You can access from our training environment. If we go over here to our training environment, if you look at it on our Desktop, you see that we have several different icons. One of the icons is called PeopleTools 8.57 Online Help. And, if I double click on this, this should open up our help guide.

Now here I get a message that says a newer version of this online help is available. So switching to the latest version might make documentation for deprecated products available. Check with your administrator to determine which version you want to look at.

So we're currently, in this course, we're using PeopleTools 8.57. And the help guide that we was using when we first created this was update 2. But now there's a newer version of that guide for 8.57. If I click on Go to the Latest Version, now we're on PeopleTools 8.57 PeopleBooks release 3.

And, if I look underneath Development Tools over here on the left-hand side, you'll see our different guides. And one of the guides that you would see inside here is the PeopleCode Developer's Guide, the how-to guide. I can click on it to open it up and get starting with PeopleCode. So this is the first guide you'd probably start with if you're not familiar with PeopleCode.

But you can go through the different topics we have in here-- understanding the PeopleCode language, the language structure, data types, how to do comments, how to statements, how they're constructed. So this is your how-to guide, but notice you also have the API Reference guide to get information on maybe the different classes that we have inside PeopleSoft. So here I could say show me the classes for application classes. And I could get more into application classes over here.

I could come over here. As well as the API Reference guide, we have the Language Reference guide, which would give us a listing of our functions, our meta-SQL that we have in here. So you can read up through this. These guides, again, we have the shortcut on the desktop you can access. In addition, when you're inside PeopleSoft, when you're in Application Designer, you can hit F1 on a function or a method to open up the appropriate guide to get more information on it.

Additional information in PeopleSoft Online Help, the following subjects in PeopleSoft Online Help contain information that applies to PeopleCode 8.57. We have the PeopleTools 8.57 PeopleCode Developer's Guide, Language Reference guide, API Reference guide. Those are the three we just mentioned. But, in addition, you have the PeopleSoft Application Designer Developer's Guide so if you want to learn about components and pages and records and fields.

We have Application Engine. We have a PeopleSoft Integration Broker. We have the Security Administration. So these are other guides that would have useful information about doing some development.

PeopleCode syntax conventions, throughout this guide, we use typographical conventions that distinguish between different elements of the PeopleCode language such as the program code, PeopleCode keywords, variables, parameters, and other values you must apply, and optional elements. So, when we're looking through here, when we're looking at the syntax, bold highlights PeopleCode function names, business function names, event names, system functions, method names, language constructs, and PeopleCode reserve words that must be included literally in the PeopleCode code.

Italics will highlight field values emphasis and PeopleSoft or other book-length publication titles. In PeopleCode syntax, italics items are placeholders for arguments that your program must supply. Italics also highlight references to words or letters in the following example. Enter the letter O.

Key+key indicates a key combination. For example, plus sign between keys mean that you must hold down the first key while pressing the second key, like Alt+W, Alt+J.

And you see monospace font highlights a PeopleCode program or other code example. Ellipses indicates that the preceding item or series can be repeated any number of times in the syntax. And curly braces indicate a choice between two options in the syntax. Options are separated by the pipe.

Square brackets indicate optional items in the PeopleCode syntax. Ampersand, when placed before a parameter in PeopleCode syntax, an ampersand indicates that the parameter is already instantiated object. Ampersands also precedes all PeopleCode variables.

And this last little icon you see here is the continuation character. That's been inserted at the end of a line of code that has been wrapped at the page margin. The code should be viewed or entered as a single continuous line of code without the continuation character.

So, a review of this lesson, you've learned how to describe PeopleCode, how PeopleCode is used, where PeopleCode is used, how to find information about PeopleCode in PeopleSoft Online Help, and PeopleCode syntax conventions. That concludes our lesson number two.
