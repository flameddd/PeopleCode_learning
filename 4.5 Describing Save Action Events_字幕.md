Save Action Events. When you save a component, only the actual data changes are written to the database. However, all save stream PeopleCode executes regardless of the database changes.

When the user clicks the Save button, the component processor takes the data that has changed in its buffers since the last successful save action and updates it to the database. Before the component processor updates the database, it runs three PeopleCode events. As you see here, the SaveEdit, the SavePreChange, and the Workflow.

When we look at the SaveEdit, it performs consistency or relational edits among multiple fields on our record definition. It can also edit multiple rows of data inside the buffer.

You have the SavePreChange that does any last-minute processing just before the component processor updates the database. You have the Workflow. It can trigger a business event. Workflow PeopleCode programs typically review the data in the buffer, check a business rule, and then decide which business event to trigger, if any.

And then you have the SavePostChange. Your SavePostChange runs after the component processor issues the appropriate SQL DML commands to update the database. SavePostChange mainly updates other tables not present in the current component buffer based upon new values that were just updated. So after SavePostChange runs, then the SQL command is executed over the database.

Save Action Events, we have SaveEdit, SavePreChange, Workflow, and SavePostChange. SaveEdit, when the user clicks Save, it is the first one that's executed. It executes when the user presses the Save button. It's used to validate data before it's updated in the database.

Used for validation that references more than one field in the buffer. Supplied to all rows of data on all pages in the component at the level where it is attached except for rows that have been marked for deletion. Can be placed on Record Field or Component Record.

And it's used to do errors or warnings. Errors and warnings in your SaveEdit, note these points about errors and warnings. They validate data. An error in SaveEdit prevents the component processor from saving any row of data. SaveEdit errors can happen anywhere on the page or component or on any row of data.

You must write clear error and warning messages to help the user locate and correct the source of the error. For a warning, the component processor displays a message giving the user two choices. Click OK to accept the data, override the warning, and continue with the save process. Or click Cancel to abort the save process.

We take a look at an example. We come back over to our training environment. And let's say I do a File Open. And I'm going to open up the component PSU Course Session.

And if I go to the Structure tab and look at the Component Record PeopleGo, for the PSU course session, here's an example. If all in the PSU course session start date and the PSU course session end date-- meaning there is a value in both start date and end date-- and the PSU course session start date is greater than the PSU course session end date-- oh, say it isn't so-- then, error. And in this case, we're using a message get function.

This one says pass in the message from the message catalog, message 1040, message number 3. If we can't find that message, we're going to say message not found. Course start date must not be later than end date. If we did find the message, we'll use the message from the message catalog and pass in some bind variables at the start date and the end date.

If we come over here to our PIA, go to my NavBar, go to my Navigator, and if I go back to my root menu and go to Courses and go to Define and Course Sessions, I'm going to do a search. I'll select a row of data here.

And if I say, let's set the start date to be 2018 and the end date is 2013, when I hit my Save button, that should cause my SaveEdit event to get executed. And you see, I get the error. Course start date must not be later than course end date. And you see the message 1040, message number 3.

And we come back over here to our slides. SavePreChange, the SavePreChange event runs after SaveEdit completes successfully. It's your last chance to manipulate data before the database is updated. Can perform additional calculations or modify display characteristics depending on the validated values entered into the component. Can be placed on Record Field, Component Record, or Component. And it's not used for errors or warnings.

Typically, SavePreChange is a good time to generate keys, especially if sequential. Might be used for cascading updates. If we put in a purchase order maybe and we just reduced our items when we put in that purchase order, well, in the inventory table is where the items would be reduced. This would be a good place to set SavePreChange PeopleCode on the purchase order to update the inventory that's inside the inventory table if it's inside the buffer.

If we come and look at an example of this over here, if I go back to our training environment, and I'm going to go back to Application Designer. And if I do a File Open, and I'm going to say Record. And if we look at the record in here called PSU Purchase Order Details. And if I go in here to my field called Order Number and take a look at the PeopleCode, here you see an example of SavePreChange on this one.

This one right here is calling a function called Assign Order Number. But here we see if the purchase order or detail order number is equal to new and the mode is equal to add, then let's assign an order number to the purchase order/detail order number field. So this would go out there, call that function to go and calculate an order number to be used.

And if we looked at this over here in the PIA, I go to my NavBar, go to my Navigator. And if I go into my Purchasing and Maintain Purchase Orders, and we add a new value. And notice the default for order number is new. I'm going to keep it as new.

And if I come in here and say I want to order item-- and I'll say, just going to order one. And we'll say the price of this is $1,500. Whoops-- how about $1,050? Is that a little better? And if I come in here and hit Save, when I go to Save, that's when it's going to execute our code here. And you can see it went and assigned an order number of 67 for me when I hit the Save.

You might be asking, why do we wait to be able to save this on the SavePreChange? Why don't we calculate that order number when they first come into the page? Well, they might have came in here to put in the order. And then they might have decided, nope, I don't want to, and exit out of the page without saving. And then we would have wasted an order number. So probably not the best thing to do.

Workflow-- the only PeopleCode related to Workflow should be in this PeopleCode event. You can place it on Record Field or Component. It's not used for errors. It's not used for warnings.

When we talk about Workflow, Workflow is about automating a process. We don't get into it in this particular course. You'll learn all about that in the PeopleSoft Workflow class. So that's a four-day class that will cover of this Workflow event.

SavePostChange, so SavePostChange is processed after the SQL statement to update the database but before the commit. Can be used to update data in tables that are not in the component buffer. Can be placed on Record Field, Component Record, or Component. It's not field-specific. It's not used for errors. It is not used for warnings.

Typically, SavePostChange is a good time for integration. Maybe you want to send a message to the Integration Broker and let it subscribe to it on a receiving side. It's also a good place for cascading updates when tables that are not in the buffer and we want to use a SQL statement to do an update.

If we take a look at an example of that, if I come back over here to my Application Designer, and let's say I do an Open, and I say Open Component. And we'll say open up the PSU Customer Component. I'll Right-Click on the PSU cust component and say View PeopleCode.

Here's an example of PeopleCode on the SavePostChange. If field changed for customer tables-- street 1, city, state, zip, country, or phone-- then do a SQL exec to update these fields in the student table. And if I do an Alt-0, give myself a little more room here, I can read this a little better. But we'll get into this SQL exec a little bit later in the class. So we'll take a look at what it's doing.

But if I come over to my PIA, and I go to my NavBar and I go to my Navigator, if I come over here and go into Customers and General Information. If I search for a customer, let's say CONS, and I search here. And let's say I make a change to this address information. I'm going to come in here and change this information from 777 Avenue at the Palms to be 123 Something. I'll save that.

Now, if I come back over to my NavBar and I go into my Recent Places, if I go back into Personal Information, and let's search for students who are part of CONS. And if I look at Carol, Carol doesn't have the same address here. But if I look at the next row of data-- does anyone have the same address? Here we go. And you can see Joanne at the same address as Customer, so it changed it to be the 123 Something.

Activity 8, Placing WinMessage and Save Action Events. In this activity, you'll review the activity overview and place WinMessage in a SaveEdit event so that you can see exactly when this event runs in the component processor flow.
