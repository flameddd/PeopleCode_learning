Activity 10-- Reviewing the Programs That Synchronize Student Addresses with Customer Addresses. In this activity, you will review the activity overview and look at how PeopleCode is used to synchronize PSU_STUDENT_TBL with PSU_CUST_TBL.

Activity Overview. You have seen RowInit and FieldChange programs that enable or disable fields in PSU_STUDENT_TBL based upon the value of the Same Address as Customer checkbox on the Personal Details page. You also saw that FieldChange program populates the Personal Details page with values from PSU_CUST_TBL if a user selects the Same Address as Customer checkbox.

The purpose of these programs is to maintain data integrity. If a student is meant to have the same address as their employer or customer, then PeopleCode should prevent a user from making any changes that will break that relationship. If address data in the PSU_CUST_TBL changes, then a system must update the appropriate students related to that customer to reflect the new information. SavePostChange program is used for that purpose.

In this activity, you will review the RowInit PeopleCode on PSU_STUDENT_TBL, review the FieldChange PeopleCode on the PSU_STUDENT_TBL, table consider how SavePostChange PeopleCode is used to synchronize PSU_CUST_TBL data to PSU_STUDENT_TBL.

Activity Detailed Steps. Perform the activity detailed steps to complete the activity.

Reviewing the RowInit it PeopleCode on the PSU_STUDENT_TBL. In this task, you will create a search list containing all students who work for customer XYZ. And use the Next in List button to review each student. so you can observe the effects of the Same Address as Customer button.

To review the RowInit, PeopleCode used a synchronized PSU_STUDENT_TBL with PSU_CUST_TBL. Create a search list of all students who work for customer XYZ. To do that, we're going to select Students, Personal Information. On the Search page, we'll XYZ in the Customer field, and we'll click the Search button. We'll select the first student, which is Mark Larsen.

So if we come over here to our PIA, if I go into my Nav bar, Navigator, go to Students, Personal Information. For Customer, I'll put in XYZ, and I'll do a Search. And if I select, we see we've got 58 students. We see the first one is Mark Larsen. Click the Next in List button to look at each student. Observe the relationship between the Same Address as Customer checkbox and the student's address fields. If the Same Address as Customer checkbox is selected, then the address fields are disabled and cannot be changed. If the Same Address as Customer checkbox is deselected, then the address fields are enabled, and you can change the values.

So if we take a look at this one right here, here you see this one is disabled, because it's selected Same Address as Customer. And you see the customer's address is 1776 Mount Diablo Boulevard. If I click in Next in List, Stevens does not have Same Address as Customer, so the fields are enabled. It looks like he has the same address, but the fields are enabled, so we could change it.

So if I wanted this to be something else, notice I could type it in here. I could spell it correctly too, but I didn't. If I come in here, Theresa, Same Address as Customer, and you see they're disabled, same thing with Joanne, same thing again with Steven Franks, same thing with Mark. And I can keep going through here. It looks like most of them have it set to be Same Address as Customer. But again, if a field is not selected as Same Address, then you could have a different address listed in here.

The RowInit program that disables the address field is listed here. So if I look further down here, you see Same Address as Customer, RowInit PeopleCode is being used here. So you see where we've declared the record PSU_STUDENT_TBL. We instantiated the object PSU_STUDENT_TBL to be a pointer to the record PSU_STUDENT_TBL.

And it says, we could also create an object for the PSU_CUST_TBL record, but it's not necessary and would only be extra code. Here it says, if the object PSU_STUDENT_TBL Same Address as Customer's value is equal to "Y." Here you see we're saying set the fields for STREET1, CITY, STATE, ZIP, COUNTRY, and PHONE. The property enabled to be false, so that grays them out.

Reviewing FieldChange PeopleCode on PSU_STUDENT_TBL. In this task, you will deselect the Same Address as Customer checkbox, which will invoke a FieldChange program. And you'll observe the effects. Then you will observe the effects of that FieldChange program. To review the FieldChange, PeopleCode used a synchronized PSU_STUDENT_TBL and PSU_CUST_TBL.

Access the Personal Detail page for Mark Larsen. You can either click on Return to Search button and select Mark Larsen. Or click the Previous in List button until you find Mark Larsen. I will choose to go back to Return to Search and select Mark Larsen from here.

Click the Same Address as Customer checkbox to deselect it. Notice the address fields are enabled. So we did that a couple of moments ago. I deselect it. Now they're enabled, can change it to whatever I want it to be.

Change Mark's street address to be One Larson Way. Select the Same Address as Customer checkbox, and notice the address fields are disabled. And know Mark's street address reverts to an address in the PSU_CUST_TBL. This is a FieldChange program that enables or disables the address fields and synchronizes the address data.

Identify the section of code that updates the address fields when the Same Address as Customer checkbox is selected. So if I come back over here, notice I select this, and now it disables. If we go back over here into our guide, then we'll have the PeopleCode listed next. So here's our PeopleCode, and notice this FieldChange PeopleCode declared our object for PSU_STUDENT_TBL, instantiated it to be a pointer to the student table.

And here you see if the student table's Same Address as Customers' value is equal to a "Y." So we're saying, if it's been selected, we're going to set the Enabled field for the STREET, CITY, STATE, ZIP, COUNTRY, PHONE to be false. So Enable would be false. And then we're going to come in here and say let's get the value from the customer table. So STREET1, CITY, STATE, ZIP, COUNTRY, PHONE's value is getting the corresponding field value from the customer table. Else, we can see in here that we're saying, if it's not checked, then we're going to go out there and set the STREET1, CITY, STATE, ZIP, COUNTRY, and PHONE to be enabled true, or the user could type in the data.

Considering how SavePostChange PeopleCode is used to synchronize PSU_CUST_TBL, data to the PSU_STUDENT_TBL. In the two previous walkthroughs, you saw how PeopleCode and PSU_STUDENT_TBL kept data in PSU_STUDENT_TBL synchronized with PSU_CUST_TBL. In this task, you will consider how changes to PSU_CUST_TBL can trigger PeopleCode that will update the PSU_STUDENT_TBL as needed. To consider how SavePostChange PeopleCode is used to synchronize the PSU_CUST_TBL to PSU_STUDENT_TBL. So select customers' general information and access XYZ.

So if I come back over here and go to my Nav bar, go to my Navigator, go back out to my root level, and choose to go into Customers, and say General Information. And I'll say no on saving my data. And I'll select for XYZ. Change the customer's address to 1 PeopleSoft Way, Pleasanton, California, 90210, and Save the component. Come over to the address here, and I'll say, 1 PeopleSoft Way, and we'll say Pleasanton, USA, California, zip code 90210. And we'll go ahead and hit our Save.

Once again, create a search list of students who work for customer XYZ. Notice that the address changed for each student with the Same Address as Customer option selected. So if we come over here and take a look at that-- I did Save that, didn't I? Let me make sure. And if I come over here to my Nav bar, go back into my Personal Information, and we search for XYZ, and select a row of data, now you can see the address has been changed to 1 PeopleSoft Way.

This is the PeopleCode that made that happen. So on the Customer component, we have SavePostChange PeopleCode. If field changed, the Customer table STREET1, CITY, STATE, ZIP, COUNTRY, or PHONE, then they're doing a SQLExec to update the PSU_STUDENT_TBL set where STREET1 is bind variable 1, CITY is bind 2, STATE- 3, ZIP - 4, COUNTRY - 5, PHONE - 6, where CUSTOMER_ID is equal to bind 7, and Same Address as Customer is equal to "Y." And then you can see us passing the fields into the field-specific bind variable.

Consider which portion of the SQLExec function ensures that only relevant students get updated. Well, we're saying where the CUSTOMER_ID is equal to bind 7, that we just change the customer value. And the address customer is equal to a "Y." This concludes the activity. Please do not continue.
