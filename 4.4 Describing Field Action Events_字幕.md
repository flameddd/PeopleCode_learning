This flow chart illustrates the field action process for the relevant PeopleCode events. So field changed by user, first thing we have to pass, standard system edits. If everything passes, we go to the field edit. This is where you can set up your own validation logic.

If it passes that, then it goes to field changes. Might be where you're doing calculations or re-calculations. So if we look at these events, when it comes to the field action events, they are field edit and field change. Field edit executes after a field is changed and after the new value of the field is satisfied system edits. So your prompt table is your translate, your yes no edits.

Those have to be passed first. Validates the contents of a single field. So it is field specific.

Should not include assignment statements. And it can be placed on record field or component record field. Is used for errors and warnings. So deferred processing will affect this.

If I come over here to our training environment, and let's say I open up my-- I do a File, Open Record PSU underscore student education. Here's an example. If I go to GPA and I say show me the PeopleCode, here we have PeopleCode on the field edit. If the student education's GPA is greater than 4.0, then warning GPA higher than 4.0 is not allowed. End-If.

If we take a look at this one in the PIA-- if I come over to the PIA and go into my-- back into student personal information, if we take a look at this and do a search here and select a row of data, and let's say I go to Education and Skills. And I'm going to tell everybody I got my MBA with that 5.8 GPA. And I'll hit Save. I can't help but laugh.

I was talking to an old high school friend over the weekend. And he didn't go to college. And not saying anything negative about that, but the statement, it kind of gives you a little indication of his statement. I was talking about oh yeah, I got three kids. And two of them's graduated college, and one of them is on his way to graduating.

And I was so proud talking about how my youngest one is gotten like it 3.94. And my middle son he graduated with an accounting degree and he had at 3.98 GPA. And anyway, that's when he told me-- he goes yeah, yeah. My oldest son, he's in college right now doing excellent. I think it's a 5.8 GPA?

I was like, 5.8? Well, maybe. I don't know. Maybe it's schools have new GPA. But that's a little odd one for me.

But anyways, I don't know how to write that one. But if I come over here, notice that deferred processing will affect this. So 5.8, if I come in here and hit the refresh to tell it to go validate, it validates my field edit PeopleCode and it says warning! Warning! GPA higher than 4.0 is not allowed.

Just remember, when you're telling your old fishing stories, let the other guy go first. That way you can win. If I hit OK. and hit my home-- let's go back over here. So that's our field edit.

We have field change PeopleCode. Field change PeopleCode-- remember from your tools 2 class, we said that this is a partner event. Field change in RowInit are usually considered partners events. And the reason for that is what you do in one you typically do something very similar in the other one.

Field change is typically used for doing calculations or re-calculations to rows of data going into the buffer. Very similar to what you have at RowInit. Well, remember, RowInit is when the first time the row is encountered it executes. So typically, we're putting code on row in net for when the user is displaying a raw data that already exists [INAUDIBLE] to maybe do the calculations for the derived fields. We looked at that one earlier.

Field change executes after a field is changed and after the new value of the field has satisfied your system edits such as your prompt tables, your translate, your yes nos. And after field edit PeopleCode is completed successfully, for whatever logic you put in, calculates or recalculates. It's field specific-- can be put on record field or component record field. And it's used for errors and warnings.

So when we talk about field change, just like we've seen with field edit, this will be affected by deferred processing. Here's an example of field change PeopleCode on that purchase order application. We looked at this one earlier, when we was looking at RowInit. We was calculating the total price in the grain total when a user first comes into a page to look at a purchase order. Well, here it's saying what if someone goes out there and changes the quantity?

So here, you see that they're saying the old price-- let's see what the price was beforehand. So old price equals derived education services total price. Then we're saying the derived education services total price is equal to the purchase order details quantity multiplied times the purchase order details price.

And then we're recalculating the grand total. We're saying the derived education services grand total equals the derived education services grand total plus derived education services total price minus the old price. And this would need to be done on both the quantity and also on the price field, since there's two of them used to do the calculation.

Another example-- we come over here back to our training environment. If I go to App Designer and open up that student table again-- If I go to the same address as customer and say look at the PeopleCode, here's an example of field change where we're saying if the same address as customer's values equal to y, let's set the street, city, state, zip, country, phone-- it's a property called enable to be false. So we're going to grey them out. And then let's fetch their description from the customer table or their value. And if you look at else, let's set these fields to be enabled.

And if I go over here to my PIA, and go back in a student personal information, we can take a look in here-- if I search and I look at Mark Lawson, here you see when I first come in here RowInit got executed. That said let's grey this field out because same address customers check. Now if I deselect, this field change will execute and enable the fields. And I can put in here and say one, two, three, Great Greg Boulevard. If I check this again, field change will execute to disable and fetch it from the customer table.

So RowInit, if I was looking at the RowInit code, RowInit and field change-- notice with field change, I have an if then else. With RowInit, it's usually a subset of the field change code. And this one, you see all we're doing is saying if is equal to y, disable the fields. The data's already been populated. If it's equal to y, disable it when you first come in.

We don't need an else statement, because the default is it's already enabled if it's not equal to y. Use the-- RowInit's only executing once for the new row of data in the buffer. So I don't need a if then else statement inside this one to calculate it out.

Row action events-- the flow chart illustrates the row action processes with the relevant PeopleCode events. So we have row insert and row delete when you hit the plus sign to insert or the minus sign to delete. So again, row insert and row delete are your events for row actions. Row insert can be used to override effective data processing.

And PeopleSoft-- when you hit a plus sign on let's say a scroll area that has effective dating, it automatically copies the values for the field that you was on into the new row. Changes the effective date to be today's date. You could use row insert PeopleCode to say no, I don't want that. I want to clear those rows of data out. When I'm looking at this one, this is-- could be used for doing automatic row numbering.

So if I want to automatically increment the rows that we have, no, after row insert is executed, RowInit will execute. Pre-built imposed build does not run again, since they only run one time. If we take an example, look over here. If I come back over to my App Design, if I do a file open, and I say record, and I say let's open up the purchase order detail. And you'll see that we have a field inside here for order line.

And if I come over here and take a look at this order line number, I'll look at the PeopleCode, here's an example of row insert PeopleCode. Max line is equal to 0 for I equals 1 to active row count for the detailed table. Line is equal to fetch the value from the order detail order line number for ampersand I. So in a loop, getting each row of data and getting the value of it. If the line is greater than the max line, then max line equals line.

And End-If in 4. And then we're saying set the line number equal to max line plus 1. So what we're doing is we're going out here and always retrieving the highest line number, and then incrementing it by 1 for the new line number.

We have row delete-- executes when a user deletes a row of data, used to recalculate running totals, used to automatically number rows of data, used to prevent a row from being deleted, can be placed on record field in component record, can include error functions to prevent a row from being deleted, can include warning functions to allow a user to accept the row delete event by clicking OK or cancel-- the row delete event by clicking Cancel. And no fields can be referenced on provisionally deleted rows until the component processor removes a row from the component buffer.

So maybe we have a field on a row called status. Maybe 1 means it's active, 2 means it's not active. If a person tries to delete an active row, we could use this event to go out there and check the flag. If it's active, give them an error and say stop it from being deleted. So we can give them an error and that will stop the processing and the page will be displayed again.

If I come back over here to our training environment-- so here we've seen where we're doing a row insert, where we're always getting the highest row number. If I come over here, you see row delete. And here, you can see when we delete a line, delete line order line number-- so we're setting that variable equal for I equals 1 to active row count. Ampersand line equals fetch value from the line number for whichever row I'm on inside this for loop.

If ampersand line is greater than delete line, then update the line number ampersand I to be line minus 1. So if I'm looking at this code, if we have 4 rows in the grid, and I have line number field-- if I delete row number 2, this code is saying change line number 3 to be line number 2, change line number 4 to base line number 3, but then keeping them in order.

Brings us to another valuable activity-- activity 7. So placing WinMessage in row action events. In this activity, review the activity overview, place WinMessage in a row insert event, so that you can see exactly when this event runs in the component processor flow.
