Identifying PeopleCode events-- 

PeopleCode events, these principles apply to PeopleCode events. Every PeopleCode program is associated with a PeopleSoft application design or definition in an event. Events are pre-defined exit points into the component processor flow. As each event point is encountered, the component processor runs any PeopleCode for that event on each definition.

Certain definitions in PeopleSoft Application Designer can have an event set, a group of events that are appropriate to that definition. A definition can have zero or one PeopleCode program for each event in its event set.

Event locations, these component Application Designer definitions have events that are associated with the component processor. We have components. Components include components, component records, and component record fields. We have menus, menu items and pop-up menus only, pages and record fields.

So when the component processor flow, this is the different locations we could set up our PeopleCode. So remember, location, location, location. The following table maps the 17 PeopleCode events to the component processor flow. So we have SearchAction events, SearchInit, and SearchSave. Use when you're having a search page.

We have ComponentBuild in page display events, RowSelect, PreBuild, FieldDefault, FieldFormula, RowInit, PostBuild, Activate. We have FieldAction events, FieldEdit, FieldChange, RowAction events, RowInsert, RowDelete, SaveAction Events, SaveEdit, SavePreChange, Workflow, and SavePostChange.

When it comes to SaveEdit, SavePreChange, and SavePostChange, these are events that loop through all the rows that have been touched in the component buffer. So it is going to loop through all the rows of data. You'll also see later, we have a property called IsChange that we can look to see if something has been touched.

These definitions have events that are outside of the component processor flow. So application engine programs, application package definitions, component interface definitions, and message definitions can also have PeopleCode associated with them. Each of these definitions have a specific event or event set associated with it.

However, these events are not events, per se, and are not associated with the component processor flow. This flowchart illustrates the search process with the relevant PeopleCode events. So here you see, determine the component. So again, we went signed into the PM. Maybe we went to the nav bar in Navigator, went to a folder, clicked on a content reference. It pointed us to a component.

And then that component is going to get loaded. It's going to build a search page based upon the search record of the component, possibly. It's going to go out there and do a reset state, which is going to clear all the buffers for the component, so it flushes the buffer.

And then, we have an event called SearchInit we'll take a look at in just a couple moments. After the SearchInit event, you'll see the SearchPage up here. Are you on the add? Are you doing add or you're doing a find an existing value? Again, you'll see the flow will differ, depending upon which one. If they're not doing an add, then you see we have SearchSave event would also be executed next.

And then you'd see, taking the key, when a user has selected a row from the search results to be able to do the SQL select and load the buffer. Now, you can see, on SearchSave, SearchSave could be checking and doing some validation. Now one thing I'll mention is, be careful about putting errors or warnings on events where they are not valid for.

PeopleSoft will let you do it. We'll give you all the rope in the world to hang yourself. So be careful. So if you end up putting errors or warnings inside events that do not allow for them, it'll let you do it, but when a user is running it through the user interface, and they go to save the page, and you have a error on a location that's not allowed, you'll get a component invalid, and the user won't be able to save the data.

So make sure when you're setting up errors and warnings, you only do it on events that it's allowed in. So looking at SearchInit, SearchInit is executed just before a search page or add dialog page is displayed. And it controls processing before a user enters values in the search dialog fields.

So what would I use SearchInit to be used for? Well, I might go out and use the SearchInit to be able to go out there and set the value of a field. So maybe when a user, before they even go into the search page, maybe we have a search key out there that is going to be the EMPL ID.

So I might say, set the personal data employee ID equal to the percent employee ID who's currently signed in. So make it equal to the employee ID who's currently sign in using the system. Or maybe I want to go out here and enable or disable field.

So here you see, gray personal data EMPL ID. And maybe I'm setting a value to the users currently signed in. And then I want to gray that field where the user can't change it and put any other user in. Maybe I want to hide or unhide a field. So maybe hide the student table dot customer ID. Or maybe I just hide the EMPL ID altogether, where the user doesn't see that one.

So before the user even sees the search page, I can set up this logic. I can enforce required fields and record field edits. So here you can see a search edit PSU student table dot customer ID to force a validation to occur on the field. Control security access-- I could say allow EMPL ID change is equal to true.

The component processor, by default, doesn't allow a user to make any changes to a record if the record contains the EMPL ID, a key field, and its value matches the user currently signed in. So for example, if I'm looking at my salary, and I'm out there and that's keyed by the EMPL ID, and I'm looking at my salary for me, it doesn't allow me to change it.

So this right here would allow you to set up PeopleCode to override that. Allow EMPL ID change true, says, yep, you can change it. Control of the user will see a search page. So set SearchDialogBehavior zero. Let's skip the search page and go directly into the component.

Now when it comes to SearchInit, some things are not allowed to be used. Certain functions are not allowed to be used in SearchInit processing. Do modal, do modal eggs, do modal component, do modal x component, transfer, transfer exact, transfer node, transfer pay, transfer portal are not allowed. Those functions are not allowed in the SearchInit event.

Now starting in PeopleTools 8.5, you can also use PeopleCode on the SearchInit and SearchSave events on search keys of prompt tables. So used to be only for search records, but can also be used for prompt tables as well now.

Whenever the user returns to the search page, the SearchInit is triggered. Note the search page has its own buffer. The variables for the search page will not be passed into the pages that have values passed to it from the pages.

So here's an example of SearchInit. Without any code whatsoever, if we type XXX for customer on the search page and click Search, we will receive no error and will receive no data. So here it's showing you, look for all the students who belong to customer XXX. I don't get an error. XXX is not a valid value. It just doesn't show me any data because we don't have any customers who belong to XXX since that's not a valid value.

I could use the SearchInit. I could go out and set up SearchInit PeopleCode. I could say set SearchEdit PSU student table dot customer ID. And if I do that, now when they go into the search page, if they put in XXX for customer, they'll get a opportunity. It'll tell them that that is an invalid value. What are they thinking?

So that's an example of where we could have an opportunity. If we come over here and take a look at another example out here that we could take a look at that, take a look at what's going on, if I come over here in AppDesigner, and let's say, let me do an open, and I'm going to go in here and open up a record.

And I'm going to say, open up the PS user self search record. And you see that this one is a dynamic view. And notice I got PeopleCode on OPR ID, if I right click on it and say, show me the PeopleCode. Here you see an example of SearchInit processing. And here, it says, PS user search OPR ID is equal to percent user ID.

So that says, make it equal to the user ID who is currently signed in. And if I come over here, and right now, if I just set it up like it is right now, and I'm going to go in here and test it, if I go into my PIA, and I go over to my nav bar, if I go in here to my Navigator, and I look at My System Profile, you'll notice, here I see a search page now.

And on the search page, notice the user ID begins with PT code. So you see it's equal to the user ID that I'm signed into. Now if I come back over here into my Application Designer, notice there's a rim. This is how we can do comments, so I'm going to uncomment this rim statement here that says, set search dialog behavior to zero.

We said, this right here is going to-- when I pass a zero as my parameter, that says, skip the search page. So if I uncomment that out and save this, now let's go test this one. If I come back over here and go back into that again, notice it skips my search page altogether.

So I didn't get a search page. It says, you've already loaded, to the PeopleCode, the high level key. You don't need the search page. So we skipped it altogether. Things such as when I looked over here, you see percent user ID, you could see percent EMPL ID, percent date, these are system variables that we can use inside of PeopleSoft.

Come back over here. SearchSave. SearchSave can be used to keep a user from going forward. If a manager tried to search for an employee who's not in his department, I could give him an error, and give him the search page again. So you see, after the SearchInit, now the user has got the values out here onto the page, and then you could see that they could use a SearchSave inside here.

SearchSave PeopleCode is performed after the user clicks the Search button or the Add button on the search page. Validates values entered into the search fields. You place this on search key or alternate search key fields on a search record or component search record. And they can use error and warning functions to give messages to the user.

When I'm doing SearchInit, SearchInit is not for doing errors and warnings. So do not use errors and warnings on SearchInit. But when I'm on SearchSave, I can use errors and warning messages inside here. It is field specific out here for your search keys or alternate search keys. Those are the only things that I can be placing this one on.

The same thing was true on SearchInit. It's used for search keys and alternate search keys. Neither SearchInit or SearchSave is triggered when the user selects a row from the results. Doesn't matter when they're selecting a row. So here's an example of a SearchSave.

Here you see in this, for a customer that we're looking at, here you see on the customer ID field that I have on the student table, we got SearchSave set up to say, if none in student table dot customer ID, none says if there's not a value. If the user didn't put a value into that record field, then error, customer field is required when searching for students.

So here you can see on the search page, I didn't place anything in the customer field, and since I didn't place anything in the customer field, you see we got a opportunity. I come back over here to our training environment, and let's say I open up a different record. If I say, file open record, and I say, let's open PS OPR definition, well, put a little bit more searching in this one-- OPR. There we go. PS OPR def and search.

If I open up this one right here and take a look at it, we see we got PeopleCode on OPR ID. If I say, show me the PeopleCode, and I'm going to come in here and take a look. Here you see we got SearchInit PeopleCode, but I'm going to look at SearchSave.

And here we got all kinds of fun SearchSave PeopleCode. So if I look through this quickly, it says, if mode is add mode, then-- and here, we've got a variable ampersand find equals, and we're saying find, and we're saying look for a space in the OPR ID. If ampersand find is greater than zero, so they found it, give them an error.

So you can't have a space inside the OPR ID. If uppercase, opera ID is equal to PPL Soft, give them an error. If it finds a semicolon, give them an error. If it finds a colon in the OPR ID, give them an error. If it finds a ampersand in the OPR ID, give them an error. Of it finds a less than or greater than sign in the OPR ID, give them an error.

If it finds a forward slash, if it finds a comma-- I'm sorry, a double quote-- if it finds a bracket, give them an error. If it finds an open parentheses, closed parentheses, give them an error. So look at all these rules we have when setting up OPR IDs out here.

So here you see, now they're declaring a variable local string mastering character 34. And when I'm looking at this one, it says, if find greater than zero, give them an error. What in the world is going on on that one? What could it all mean?

So local string mastering character 34, we find my string, give him an error. Well, some of you probably know this from older languages, but when you say character 34, that's the ASCII code for double quotes. So make sure the name does not have any double quotes, is what that one's doing.

So if we come over here, and we've seen all these rules that we have out here, if I come in here, and let's say I go to the PIA again, and I go to my nav bar, I go to my Navigator, I come out here, and I go to my PeopleTools, and I go to Security, and I go to User Profiles, and I go into User Profiles, let's see what happens if I come in here and I click Add to add a new user.

I'm going to add a brand new user that has never been added before. I'm going to put in Swenson, comma, Greg. I think that sounds good. But when I click on Add, I get an opportunity. It says, what are you thinking? You can't put a comma in your name. Well, we've seen that in the PeopleCode. That's exactly what we're thinking.

So that brings us to an activity, activity 4, using SearchInit to control the search page. In this activity, you will review the activity overview and observe how the SetSearchDialogBehavior function can be used to bypass the standard component search page.
