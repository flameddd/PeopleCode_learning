Describing Component Build and Page Display Events. Component Build and Page Display Process. This flowchart illustrates the component build and page display process with the relevant PeopleCode events. So if we're looking over on the right hand side, you see we went from the search page-- a user has done a search. They have clicked on a row of data to be below the high-level key, take the search key, load it into the high-level key of the component.

And here on the right, you see going through the buffer, reading the rows of data, loading them in. And you see one of the events that are going to be encountered is called RowSelect. In a couple moments, we'll be talking about this process and what RowSelect is used for. And then you can see over to the left the next events that would be executed during the processor flow. But again, these are the things we'll be looking at in the next few slides.

The Component Build and Page Display Events. That component built and page display events are, you have RowSelect, PreBuild, FieldDefault, FieldFormula, RowInit, PostBuild, and Activate. PreBuild and PostBuild execute only once during the component build. Activate executes whenever the page gains focus. The component build and page display events are applicable to Fluid applications as well.

RowSelect. RowSelect controls which rows are loaded into the component buffer. They can be placed on a record field or component record, can include errors and warnings, but will not appear to the user. So when we talk about RowSelect, we tell you it should not be used in new code. So what we would recommend you use instead of doing RowSelect is to be able to go create a view.

So create a record view, underscore search, or whatever it might need to be, and use the view to determine which rows get loaded into the buffer. So that's a better method than using the RowSelect event. As we're looking at this, we said it's going to be used to go out there and stop loading rows into the buffer by using a stop fetch function or a discard function.

When we look at the discard function, discard function prevents a row from loading by using the DiscardRow function. We also have the StopFetching event. This is going to be used to stop fetching the information. Stop loading the rows into the buffer by using these StopFetching function.

So the purpose of this RowSelect, again, is what we did in older releases into this PeopleSoft. We would use to RowSelect to determine what rows we wanted to put into the buffer. So as we're going out there and building, doing the SQL SELECT, once we selected the row, we would go out and use the RowSelect event.

And we may have some condition out there that says we don't want to use this row. So we could go out and use the function called DiscardRow. So it prevents a row from being put into the buffer. Then it would go back to the SQL SELECT that says, hey, do we have any more rows? Then go to the next one. Then we could see if we want that one in the buffer or not. If we didn't, we'd use the DiscardRow. If we did, we would have else and put it into the buffer.

We had the StopFetching. StopFetching might be used when we only want to get a limited number of rows. So as we're going through the buffer to load the data using the SQL SELECT to load it into the buffer, once we've got enough rows, we could do a StopFetching. And StopFetching would stop loading any other rows in the buffer. It wouldn't continue grabbing rows that have been met by the SQL SELECT.

Should not be used in the new code. Use a search view, an effective-dated record, or the Select method or ScrollSelect or related functions to filter the rows. If we take a look at an example of this-- we'll come back over here. And in my Application Designer here, I'm looking at a record up here, the a PeopleSoft Report List Distribution ID in the RowSelect event.

And here you can see they've declare a couple variables out here, UserMaxReports and CurrentNumber. And here we've got an if statement saying if the percent component-- meaning the component you're currently executing-- if it's equal to PSRF_RLIST_COMP-- if that's the name of the component that you're currently executing, then set the CurrentNumber equal to CurrentNumber plus 1.

And then you see we have if the CurrentNumber is equal to the UserMaxReport number plus 1, StopFetching. And you'll notice both of these are declared as components, so the values could be set up on a component or other code of what the values would be equal to coming into this. But here it says we've got enough rows, so we can stop matching the rows of data.

PeopleSoft applications do not use a whole lot of RowSelect PeopleCode. Instead, the application filters out rows of data using views. So rows of data then can be filtered out before putting into a component buffer. By using a view, your performance will be increased due to eliminating two operations-- retrieving a row of data and then discarding it.

Also, for effective-dated tables, the Update Display action automatically stops the download of history. And just to let you know previously, a warning was used to perform the function of DiscardRow, and error was used to perform that function of StopFetching. However, no message was displayed. This functionality is still supported for backwards compatibility. But PeopleSoft recommends that you use DiscardRow or StopFetching if you're going to be wanting to do that in this RowSelect.

PreBuild. Once we've got all the rows of data into the buffer that we want, the next step that we're going to go into is the PreBuild event. PreBuild executes only once. Often used to hide or untied pages. Can be used to set global or component scope variables. Can only be placed on the component, and should not include errors or warnings.

Now technically, PreBuild will accept errors and warnings, which can be used to validate a value selected from the search results list on the search page. However, errors and warnings are not recommended in the PreBuild. If PreBuild PeopleCode program issues an error, the user is returned to the search page. If the program issues a warning statement, that component is canceled.

If there is no search page-- that is, the search record has no keys-- the component is canceled for both errors and warning statements. So if we take a look at this right here, if I come back over here to our training environment again, I'm going to open up a component. I'll do a File, Open Component, and let's say the Change Password component.

And if I go to my structure, you can say we have PeopleCode on the component itself. If I say show me that PeopleCode, here you see the PreBuild. And in this case, if I'm looking at it right here, you see it's declaring a function to GetUse-- GetUserDescription PeopleCode FUNCLIB_PTSEC_OPERID FilledFormula.

And here it says if none in the OPERDESCRIPTION field, then PSUSERSELF_SEARCH_OPERDEFINITIONDESCRIPTION is going to be using the function GetUserDescription to be able to determine what gets brought back into this field. If none is in the PSUSER_SEARCH_OPERDEFINITIONDESCRIPTION, then set the field for the OPERDESCRIPTION equal to the user ID.

So this when I first come in here on the PreBuild. If we take a look at this one right here, if I come back over to my PIA and I sign out. And let's say I sign back in here and I'm going to sign in as PTSVTR. And if I go to my nav bar, and if I go to my Navigator, and if I scroll down and click on Change My Password to execute that component, notice up here you've got the user ID. And notice the description.

So the description is set to the same thing as the user ID. So based upon that code, we went out there and said, let's take a look out here for this field that's on the screen called Work Text 254. And if nothing's in it, let's go get the description from that function. If there's nothing in the Text 254, then set it equal up to our description, and the same as the user ID. Set the description equal to the user ID. And you can see that being applied here.

FieldDefault. When we look at our FieldDefault option here, FieldDefault is the next thing that gets executed. And if I'm looking at it, it says applies to blank fields only. So notice when it goes does PreBuild, then it goes reset defaults to use the system defaults, going through the system edit information.

So looks at the record definition for the Record field to see if there's any default value that needs to be loaded. If there's nothing loaded from the record FieldDefault value, then it uses the FieldDefault. If record default applied on the field, then FieldDefault does not execute.

It's field specific. It's not for errors and it's not for warnings. If I come back over here to our training environment, let's say I go back in here to Application Designer. I'm going to-- what do I have open? Not what I want. I'm going to come over here and do a File, Open. And I'm going to open up a component, PSU_STUDENT. And if I come in here to my structure inside here, and here you see my search record.

I come over here and look at my level 0 by student table. And I'm going to come in here and play some PeopleCode on here. Now, I can either do it at that Component Record Field, or I can set it up at the Record field. Either way. I'm going to come in here and I think I'll say view definition to set it up on the Record field.

I come over here to STUDENT_NAME. And what did I say? Well, let's go over here and-- oh, I want to use this subrecord. I'll tell you what I'll do. Instead of doing it all the way down here at the subrecord-- let me close this back. I could come in here and expand this. And here you see I'll just do it at the Component Record Field.

If I go to the COUNTRY field and I right click and say, show me the PeopleCode, and I go to my FieldDefault, I could come in here and say let's set the COUNTRY field to be equal to-- and I could say USA. Now, I'm doing it at Component Record Field here. And if I save this, now I come back in here to the PIA-- and let's say I go back in the Student Personal Information.

All right, forgot to sign out and sign back in as a valid user for that application. I'm going to come back over to my nav bar. Go to my navigator. Go in there to my Students, and go into my Personal Information. And let's say I go to add a new value. I click on Add. And notice the Country field. Now the Country field is set to USA. Got to love it when a plan comes together.

Now, if the record field had already had a default value, then it would have skipped my FieldDefault. So if I came over here perhaps and said-- I'm going to go ahead and-- well, it'll be OK. I'll come in here and I'll go to my record definition. And if I came in here to the subrecord, and if I came in here to COUNTRY-- oh, let's see what this one has in it. Not what we want.

But if I came in here to COUNTRY, I could have double clicked on this one and set up a record default value down here. I could have said, make this one equal to CAN. And if I'd done this, then the field default would not execute. Record fields should not have both FieldDefault PeopleCode and record-level default associated with it. A record-level default would apply anywhere the record is used, where using Component Record Field PeopleCode would occur only for that component.

The next one we have is FieldFormula One thing I failed to mention a few seconds ago talking about FieldDefault. What constitutes an empty value for a field? So we said it only gets applied if there's nothing in the field. Well, if it's a number field, 0 is the same thing as empty. If it's a character field, a space is the same thing as empty. All others, it's checking to see if the field is null.

FieldFormula. FieldFormula gets applied after FieldDefault, as you can see in this flow. Should only be used for function libraries and web libraries. Only on a record field. Always processed, so there's some significant overhead to it. And it's not for errors or warnings itself.

So when we're looking at our FieldFormula, every time a user changes a value in a field, does the field edits, the field change, and the FieldFormula. So there's lots of overhead that's going to be executed. So typically, FieldFormula is only used for functions and for web libraries. Now, web libraries and iScript, it's a specialized PeopleCode function that's used to generate dynamic web content. So we don't really get into any web libraries in here, but just for those of you with inquiring minds.

If I take a look at an example where this is used, if we go back over here, and if I open up that student table, here we see the STUDENT_ID. If I go back in the PeopleCode, here you see we're using a function here called assign_student_id. If I right click and open up that function, notice this function is being applied on a record field called FUNCLIB_PSUSTUDENT_ID. So the FUNCLIB is the record, PSUSTUDENT_ID is the field. FieldFormula. And you can see what this function is doing is used to assign a new student ID number when we're in add mode.

FieldFormula event will be used even less as development uses application classes instead of application of specific function libraries. So a little bit later in the course, we'll be getting into application classes. And we'll see that we create methods inside there that we'll use instead of creating necessarily functions.

You can still create functions. But again, we use a lot more methods today. RowInit. So after I use the PreBuild, reset defaults, FieldDefault, FieldFormula, and then you see if it's the first time the row's been displayed is yes, then let's go do RowInit. So it's preparing the row to be displayed.

Controls the initial appearance of fields. Calculates values. Might be used to hide, unhide, enable, disable fields. Performed the first time the component processor encounters a row of data. Record field or component record it can be placed on. And executed when user inserts a new row of data. So it's fired when the Insert button gets pressed.

And you might be thinking to yourself, what happens if I go to use this and this is on a grid and someone hits the Plus to insert a new row of data? Well, I said that when a user clicks the plus sign to insert a new row, it's going to go out here and go through this RowInit processing. Well remember, when your user hits a Row Insert-- when they hit the plus sign to insert a new row, it might have that option out there that allows multi-row insertions.

Or they might say, I want to insert five rows. Or maybe they say, I want to insert 10 rows. The users selects 10, then RowInit will fire once for each row. So they say 10 times. It'll go to a loop. RowInit is basically-- that's what it is. It is a loop. It's equivalent to a for loop in other languages.

It'll loop through all the rows being loaded into the buffer before the page is being displayed. If we take a look here, here's an example of RowInit. So this is looking at the record PSU Purchase Order Detail RowInit PeopleCode. And here you see we've got these work fields, Derived Education Services Total Price and a work field called Derived Education Services Grand Total.

These are fields that are placed on the page, but they don't exist in the database table. They are used to show totals at runtime. And in this RowInit, we're saying when a user first comes into the page, remember as soon as the first time the row is being processed, it's going out here and executing RowInit. So it says set the total price equal to the quantity from the PSU Purchase Order Detail multiplied times the price from the Purchase Order Detail. Then set the grand total to be equal to the grand total plus the total price.

And it's going through a loop for each row being read, calculating the information. So it calculates the total price, which shows up on each line. And then it adds that into the grand total. And the grand total is going to be an accumulation of all the grid rows, and gets displayed down below here.

It's not field-specific. It's not used for errors and warnings. Typically, RowInit most often is going to be used for doing calculations for when a user first comes into the page. Or it might be used to control hiding or showing or enabling or disabling fields.

Then we have a PostBuild. With PostBuild, it's usually used to calculate values and to set page display characteristics or a page control. Executes only once. It's not for errors or warnings. And this is placed at our component level, is where you would find this one. So you have PreBuild and you have PostBuild. Each one of them only occurs one time in the execution.

Now, this execution where you see starting with a PreBuild going to PostBuild, we call that spine processing. So it goes through this for each row. But PreBuild and PostBuild only executes one time. Big difference is timing. PreBuild is typically a good place to set component and global variables that might be needed when we get to the RowInit.

PostBuild, on the other hand, might be used to hide or disable fields based upon calculations that are occurring in the RowInit. When we're talking about, again, PostBuild, it's not used for errors. It's not used for warnings. It's not field-specific. But it's the last thing that gets executed in that spine processing.

If come over here to our training environment and take a look at an example over here. If I do a File, Open, and I say Component, and I look User Maintenance Component, and if I go to my structure and look at the PeopleCode that's on this, here you'll see PostBuild PeopleCode, an example of what we might do in PostCode.

So this program here is handling a number of tasks for the Security User Maintenance component. It's declaring and initialize component-scope variables. And you'll notice when we're declaring these, you'll see in the name Panel Group. Well, in the old days, panel group was what we called a component. And you can still use panel group as a scope.

So you can set Boolean for the object save no warn. We've got a local rowset, two of them-- ampersand level 0 and level 1. Then we have a component string and a where clause. I'm not going to go through all this code right here. But you see we're doing our declaration up here and initializing values.

Then we're sorting the rowset on the rows page by the row names. Doing some workflow processing in here as well. Says the labels for permission lists on the general page. And for a period of time, after PeopleTools 8 released to our developers, the panel group scope was used before it got replaced with the component scope.

And so that's what we're looking at here. But this is, again, executed one time when the component is first being loaded. Then we have the Activate event, normally use for labeling or building a chart, maybe like a pie chart or a bar chart. May be used in Fluid applications, possibly for adding style sheet information.

Activate event came out in release 8. So 8 and higher is where you would see this. But it executes every time the page receives focus, specific to the page and accepts PeopleCode related to page display or page processing, such as for enabling a field or hiding a scroll. Used for security validation. Not for errors or for warnings.

So when it comes to the Activate, this is valid for standard pages, secondary pages. It's not valid to be used on a subpage. So if we go in here, and maybe if we want to take a look at an example here-- if I come back over to App Designer, if I do a File, Open Page, and let's open up the USER_ROLES page.

And if I right click on this page, I can say, show me the page PeopleCode. And there it is. And if I'm looking at this one, you see we're declaring our objects, LOCAL GRID ampersand GRID, LOCAL GRIDCOLUMN, and GRID ampersand GRIDCOLUMN. And then you see we're hiding the push button column headers.

So you see ampersand GRID equals GetGrid and telling it what grid, the panel USER_ROLES. That's the name of the page that we're using. Then you see a comma PSROLEUSER_VW. That's the grid name page field name. So the GRID GetGrid telling it the panel is the page, so page is USER_ROLES. And then get the grid name for that page called PSROLEUSER View.

And then we're saying the GRID.LABEL Text underscore Label dot Label, and we're saying let's set it the blank. So this would be the column out here. And then you can see doing some additional information in here. So you can see we're hiding the view definition column if it's distribution user component.

So if the component is equal to the user maintenance distribution component, then the GRIDCOLUMN Grid.GetColumn VIEW_DEFINITION and set the GRIDCOLUMN.VISIBLE to false. So we're hiding the last column in the user roles grid called VIEW_DEFINITION if the component is equal to the user maintenance distribution.

And here you see the columns that we have inside here. So if you're looking at it, here's that Route Control column. So we said if our page was the User Roles page, let's hide this one. And then you see we have the column over here for User Roles Grid, and we're setting up the name of it. And if we come back over here to our PIA, we can take a look at this by coming out here and looking at our user profile again.

And if we come over here to our Roles page, and here you can see where we're doing just that logic that we just mentioned here on this page. Brings us to activity 6, Placing WinMessage and Component Build Events. In this activity, you will review the activity overview and plays WinMessage and PreBuild and RowInit events so that you can exactly see when those events run in the component processor flow.
